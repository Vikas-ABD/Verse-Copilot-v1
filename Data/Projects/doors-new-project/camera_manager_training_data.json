    "explanation": "This script provides a comprehensive camera management system for a horror game, handling cinematic cutscenes, smooth camera transitions, and player movement control during special sequences. It's designed to create immersive cinematic experiences while maintaining seamless integration with gameplay.\n\n**Core Components:**\n- camera_manager: Main class extending creative_device for camera control\n- CutsceneCamera: First-person gameplay camera device for cinematic sequences\n- CutsceneCameraHolder: Creative prop that acts as the camera mount and movement controller\n- StartSequence: Cinematic sequence device for coordinating camera transitions\n- Player character integration for stasis control and visibility management\n\n**Key Features:**\n1. **Cinematic Camera System**: Professional camera management with smooth transitions between gameplay and cutscene modes\n2. **Player Stasis Control**: Advanced player movement restriction during cinematic sequences\n3. **Smooth Camera Movement**: Precise camera positioning and movement with timing control\n4. **Visibility Management**: Player character show/hide functionality during camera transitions\n5. **Fallback Safety Systems**: Race conditions and timeout protection for reliable camera operations\n6. **Transform Management**: Precise positioning and rotation control for cinematic effects\n7. **Sequence Coordination**: Integration with cinematic sequence devices for professional transitions\n8. **Multi-Mode Camera Operations**: Support for different camera movement patterns and use cases\n\n**Camera Movement System:**\n- **MoveCameraFromPlayerToTarget()**: Moves camera from player position to a target location with smooth transition\n- **MoveCameraToTarget()**: Direct camera movement to target without player position reference\n- **MoveCameraBackToPlayer()**: Returns camera to player position and restores normal gameplay\n- **SetupCameraManager()**: Initializes camera system with player character reference\n\n**Player Control Integration:**\n- **Stasis Management**: Uses PutInStasis() and ReleaseFromStasis() for movement control\n- **Visibility Control**: Hide/Show player character during cinematic sequences\n- **Transform Tracking**: Captures and uses player position/rotation for camera calculations\n- **Character Integration**: Seamless integration with fort_character system\n\n**Cinematic Sequence Flow:**\n1. **Player Preparation**: Put player in stasis and hide character model\n2. **Camera Positioning**: Position cutscene camera at player location with offset\n3. **Sequence Activation**: Start cinematic sequence device\n4. **Camera Movement**: Smooth movement to target location with timing control\n5. **Sequence Completion**: Return camera to player and restore normal control\n6. **Player Restoration**: Release from stasis and show character\n\n**Safety and Reliability Features:**\n- **Race Conditions**: Uses race blocks to handle movement completion vs timeout scenarios\n- **Fallback Timers**: Automatic fallback to prevent camera system from getting stuck\n- **Move Result Handling**: Proper handling of MoveTo() results and failure cases\n- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging camera issues\n- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behaviors when camera operations fail\n\n**Camera Positioning Logic:**\n- **Offset Calculations**: Smart camera positioning relative to player with forward vector offsets\n- **Rotation Preservation**: Maintains proper camera orientation during transitions\n- **Transform Interpolation**: Smooth movement between positions with configurable timing\n- **Target Alignment**: Precise alignment with target transforms for cinematic effect\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- **MoveTo() Integration**: Uses creative_prop MoveTo() for smooth camera movement\n- **Transform Mathematics**: Vector calculations for camera positioning and orientation\n- **Timing Control**: Configurable movement duration for different cinematic needs\n- **State Management**: Proper tracking of camera and player states throughout sequences\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- **Death Sequences**: Camera movement to show elimination source during player death\n- **Cutscene Triggers**: Cinematic camera work for story moments and special events\n- **Environmental Reveals**: Camera movement to highlight important game elements\n- **Dramatic Moments**: Enhanced cinematic presentation for key gameplay moments\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- **Player Data System**: Coordinates with player_data for death sequences and state management\n- **Creative Devices**: Uses gameplay_camera_first_person_device and creative_prop systems\n- **Cinematic Sequences**: Integrates with cinematic_sequence_device for professional transitions\n- **Character System**: Works with fort_character for stasis and visibility control\n\n**How It Works:**\n1. **Initialization**: SetupCameraManager() establishes player character reference\n2. **Cinematic Trigger**: Game systems call camera movement functions for special sequences\n3. **Player Control**: System puts player in stasis and hides character for clean cinematics\n4. **Camera Transition**: Smooth movement from player position to target with timing control\n5. **Sequence Management**: Cinematic sequence device handles camera switching and effects\n6. **Completion**: Camera returns to player position and restores normal gameplay control\n7. **Safety Handling**: Fallback systems ensure camera never gets stuck in cinematic mode",
