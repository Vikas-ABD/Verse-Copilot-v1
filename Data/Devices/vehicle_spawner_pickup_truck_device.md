## üí™ UEFN Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Place Devices in the Level
- Add one `vehicle_spawner_pickup_truck_device` to your world.
- Add up to five `button_device` instances for control actions: Spawn, Destroy, Assign Driver, Enable, Disable.

### 2. Create a Verse Script
- Open Verse Explorer (Verse ‚Üí Verse Explorer).
- Right-click your project folder ‚Üí Create New Verse File ‚Üí name it (e.g., `vehicle_spawner_pickup_truck_example.verse`).
- Choose "Create Empty" and paste in the code sample above. Save the file.

### 3. Build the Verse Script
- From the top menu, choose: Verse ‚Üí Build Verse Code (Ctrl+Shift+B).
- Ensure "Build Succeeded" appears.

### 4. Place and Reference Devices
- Drag your new Verse device into the level.
- In the Details panel:
  - Set `TruckSpawner` to your pickup truck spawner device.
  - Link the button devices to the corresponding variables (SpawnButton, DestroyButton, etc).

### 5. Customize the Truck Spawner
- In the Details panel of the spawner, configure:
  - Respawn delay
  - Team access
  - Vehicle settings
  - Initial enabled state

### 6. Test
- Start a play session.
- Press the buttons to spawn/destroy the truck, assign a driver, or enable/disable the spawner.
- Watch logs for event confirmations.

## üß† Tips
- Use multiple truck spawners for team-based gameplay.
- Trigger gameplay logic, UI updates, or scoring from the event handlers.
- Ensure a truck is spawned before assigning a driver.

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Truck doesn‚Äôt spawn | Make sure the device is enabled and Verse is built |
| Agent not assigned | Ensure the truck exists and the agent is valid |
| No logs/events firing | Check subscriptions and Verse script bindings |

---
All major vehicle logic (spawn, destroy, enable/disable, assign driver) is controllable via Verse scripting for dynamic, interactive gameplay experiences.
