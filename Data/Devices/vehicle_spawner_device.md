üîπ **Description**

The `vehicle_spawner_device` is the **base class** for all specialized vehicle spawner devices in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). It supports dynamic spawning, enabling/disabling, and vehicle management in your island. Derived devices extend its functionality to specific vehicle types (e.g., cars, tanks, surfboards) for more control and customization.

| `Enable()`          | Enables the spawner to allow vehicle spawning.              |
| `Disable()`         | Disables the spawner from spawning vehicles.                |
| `RespawnVehicle()`  | Spawns or respawns the vehicle, removing the current one.   |
| `DestroyVehicle()`  | Destroys the currently spawned vehicle if present.          |
| `AssignDriver(agent)` | Sets the agent as the driver of the vehicle.               |
| `GetTransform()`    | Returns the world transform of the spawner.                 |
| `MoveTo()`/`TeleportTo()` | Moves or teleports the spawner (and vehicle).           |

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        VehicleSpawner.Enable()
        Print("Vehicle spawner enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        VehicleSpawner.Disable()
        Print("Vehicle spawner disabled!")

üíº **How to Use in UEFN**
1. **Place Device**: Drag a specialized vehicle spawner into your level.
2. **Configure Options**: Set respawn method, access filters, effects, etc.
3. **Add Buttons**: Place three `button_device`s labeled "Spawn", "Enable", and "Disable".
4. **Create Verse File**:
   - Right-click folder in Verse Explorer ‚Üí Create New Verse File (e.g., `vehicle_spawner_example.verse`)
   - Paste example code and save
   - Build with Ctrl+Shift+B until "Build Succeeded"
   - Drag your Verse device into the world
5. **Assign @editable References** in Details panel:
   - `VehicleSpawner`: Link to your placed spawner device
   - `SpawnButton` / `EnableButton` / `DisableButton`: Link to button devices
6. **Test**: Interact with buttons in-game to test spawning, enabling, disabling, and observe event prints.

üß† **Best Practices**
- Use events for custom gameplay logic: scoring, tracking, objectives
- Enable/Disable devices to manage vehicle access phases
- Use `.AssignDriver(agent)` for guided missions, racing, team play

|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| No vehicle spawned     | Didn‚Äôt call `RespawnVehicle()`      | Use button/event/script to trigger spawn     | Explicit call needed to spawn vehicle        |
| Players can't interact | Wrong team/class setting            | Configure correct team/class in Details      | Spawner restricts access without config      |
| Code not working       | @editable fields not assigned       | Assign all references in Details             | Verse code fails without proper linking      |
| Deprecated events used | Using `VehicleSpawnedEvent`         | Switch to `SpawnedEvent` and `DestroyedEvent`| Legacy events not supported in new Verse     |

---

üí° **Note:**
- Always use a **specific derived spawner** for the intended vehicle (e.g., `vehicle_spawner_sports_car_device`).
- The `vehicle_spawner_device` provides core logic for spawning, events, and state control, extendable in your custom devices.
