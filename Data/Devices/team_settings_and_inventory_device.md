# Team Settings and Inventory Device Documentation (UEFN - Verse)

## üìô Description

The `team_settings_and_inventory_device` enables advanced customization of team settings and inventory rules in Fortnite's Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). This device overrides the default My Island team/inventory setup, allowing developers to configure health, shields, classes, item loadouts, respawn rules, and more per team. It is ideal for class-based or asymmetric team mechanics and custom game loops.

## üõ†Ô∏è Verse Usage Example

```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

team_settings_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    TeamDevice : team_settings_and_inventory_device = team_settings_and_inventory_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        # Subscribe to key team events
        TeamDevice.EnemyEliminatedEvent.Subscribe(OnEnemyEliminated)
        TeamDevice.TeamMemberEliminatedEvent.Subscribe(OnTeamMemberEliminated)
        TeamDevice.TeamOutOfRespawnsEvent.Subscribe(OnOutOfRespawns)

    # Handle when a team member eliminates an enemy
    OnEnemyEliminated(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("A member of this team eliminated an enemy! Awarding bonus.")
        # Example: award extra score, grant items, etc.

    # Handle when a team member is eliminated
    OnTeamMemberEliminated(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("A team member was eliminated!")

    # Handle all respawns lost
    OnOutOfRespawns() : void =
        Print("Team out of respawns! Ending round.")
        TeamDevice.EndRound()
```

## üìñ How to Use in UEFN

1. **Place Device(s)**

   - Add one `team_settings_and_inventory_device` for each team.
   - Set unique team #, name, class, and loadout configurations in the Details panel.

2. **Combine with Class Designer or Item Granter (Optional)**

   - Use Class Designer for more granular class settings per team.

3. **Create & Build Verse Device**

   - In Verse Explorer: Right-click a folder ‚Üí Create New Verse File (e.g., `team_settings_example.verse`).
   - Select *Create Empty*, paste sample code, and save.
   - Build the code: `Verse ‚Üí Build Verse Code` or `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

4. **Assign References**

   - Place your custom Verse device in the world.
   - Set the `TeamDevice` reference to your specific team settings device in Details.

5. **Test and Iterate**

   - Run simulations to test different team loadouts, respawns, eliminations, and win conditions.

## üß† Tips

- **Device hierarchy precedence:**
  1. My Island (global)
  2. Team Settings & Inventory (per-team)
  3. Class Designer (per-class, overrides team settings)
- Use `GetTeamMembers()` to dynamically manage or monitor team composition.
- Leverage events for advanced logic: rewards, stats tracking, round control.

| Issue                       | Cause                           | Solution                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Team setups not applied     | Device not linked or team unset | Assign correct team and configure overrides |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Place separate devices for each team to ensure correct custom settings.
