### üîπ Description
The `disguise_device` allows you to apply cosmetic disguises to players, giving them the appearance of a different character model or role. Disguises can be applied automatically on spawn or manually through Verse or gameplay triggers. They can also be removed or broken based on custom conditions (e.g., taking damage, attacking, or entering a restricted zone).

**Perfect for:**
- Stealth missions or infiltration gameplay
- Roleplay mechanics (e.g. guards, civilians)
- Deception-based PvP modes
- Objective or narrative disguises (e.g. wear a disguise to gain access)

### üö¶ Example Usage in Verse
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }

disguise_handler := class(
    @editable DisguiseDevice: disguise_device
)

OnBegin<override>()<suspends>: void =
    DisguiseDevice.Enable()
    DisguiseDevice.ApplyDisguiseEvent.Subscribe(OnDisguiseApplied)
    DisguiseDevice.BreakDisguiseEvent.Subscribe(OnDisguiseBroken)

ApplyTo(Player: agent): void =
    DisguiseDevice.ApplyDisguise(Player)

RemoveFrom(Player: agent): void =
    DisguiseDevice.RemoveDisguise(Player)

OnDisguiseApplied(Player: agent): void =
    Print("üïµÔ∏è Disguise applied to: {Player}")

OnDisguiseBroken(Player: agent, Breaker?: agent): void =
    Print("‚ö†Ô∏è Disguise broken on: {Player}")
```

### üß† Best Practices
- Use for stealth gameplay where players must blend in to bypass guards or areas.
- Combine with:
  - `trigger_device` to apply disguise when entering an area
  - `hud_message_device` to give player disguise status updates
  - `elimination_feed_device` to notify other players of disguise breaks
- Enable `Apply on Spawn` for persistent disguise roles (e.g., impostors or undercover players).
- Carefully configure disguise break conditions (attack, damage, proximity) for balance.
- If using multiple disguise devices, set `Stomp Existing Disguise = true` only when one disguise should override another.
