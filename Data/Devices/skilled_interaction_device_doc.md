üîπ **Description**
The `skilled_interaction_device` is a timing-based minigame system used to challenge players with precise input timing. When activated, players see a scrubber moving from 0.0 to 1.0 and must press a button while it‚Äôs inside the defined *Good Zone* or *Perfect Zone*.

Supports queues, multiplayer interactions, difficulty tuning, and failure/success conditions ‚Äî ideal for:
- Lockpicking minigames
- Crafting or repair mechanics
- Rhythm games or reaction tests
- Team-based coordination challenges

| `Disable(): void`                                | Disables the device and ends interactions.              |
| `BeginInteraction(agent)` / `BeginInteraction([]agent)` | Starts interaction(s). Will queue or begin immediately based on settings. |
| `EndInteraction(agent)` / `EndInteraction([]agent)`     | Cancels current interaction(s) for agent(s). Doesn‚Äôt affect queue. |
| `GetInteractingAgents(): []agent`                | Returns all agents currently in an interaction.         |
| `GetQueue(): []agent`                            | Returns the queue of agents awaiting interaction.       |
| `ClearQueue(): []agent`                          | Clears the queue and returns removed agents.            |
| `RemoveFromQueue(agent, remove_all?: logic): int`| Removes one or all instances of the agent from the queue. |
| `IsEnabled(): logic`                             | Returns whether the device is enabled.                  |
| `GetTransform()`, `MoveTo()`, `TeleportTo()`     | Standard movement/transform logic.                      |

üö¶ **Example Usage in Verse**
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }

skill_minigame := class(
    @editable SkillDevice: skilled_interaction_device
)

OnBegin<override>()<suspends>: void =
    SkillDevice.Enable()
    SkillDevice.InteractionSucceededEvent.Subscribe(OnSuccess)
    SkillDevice.InteractionFailedEvent.Subscribe(OnFail)

StartMinigameFor(Player: agent): void =
    SkillDevice.BeginInteraction(Player)

OnSuccess(Player: agent): void =
    Print("‚úÖ {Player} succeeded in the minigame!")

OnFail(Player: agent): void =
    Print("‚ùå {Player} failed the minigame.")
```

üß† **Best Practices**
- Use for lock minigames, skill checks, or crafting validation.
- Tweak `MeterSpeed`, zone sizes, and `SuccessTarget` for difficulty tuning.
- Use queue logic for multiplayer fairness and pacing.
- Combine with:
  - `barrier_device` to gate progression
  - `vfx_creator_device` for skill-based effect feedback
  - `score_manager_device` to reward perfect interactions
- Use `InteractionCanceledEvent` to handle unexpected interruptions.

‚ùå **Common Mistakes & Fixes**
| Issue                    | ‚ùå Wrong                        | ‚úÖ Fix                             | Explanation                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Device doesn‚Äôt start    | `BeginInteraction()` fails silently | Ensure device is `Enable()`d first | Device must be enabled before use.        |
| Instant failure         | `FailureLimit = 0`               | Set to 1+ for more forgiving timing | Prevents instant failure on first mistake. |
| Multiple agents overlap | `SynchronousPlayerLimit` too low | Increase limit or queue players    | Avoids interaction collisions.            |
| Queue misbehaving       | Misused `AllowDuplicatePlayerEntries` or queue size | Adjust logic carefully | Proper queue settings prevent bugs.        |

‚úÖ **Great for:**
- Lockpicking, hacking, or vault-opening mechanics
- Button-press rhythm or timing puzzles
- Multiplayer skill gates
- Combat buffs based on timing
- High-skill bonus events
