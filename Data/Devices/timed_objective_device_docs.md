üß∞ **Verse Usage Example**

```verse

using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

timed_objective_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    Objective : timed_objective_device = timed_objective_device{}

üìù **How to Use in UEFN**

**1. Place Devices**

- Place a `timed_objective_device` into your world.
- Add `button_devices` for each control you want (start, stop, pause, etc.).

**2. Configure Options**

- In Details, set timer, score, teams allowed, labels/prompts, urgency mode, etc.

**3. Create and Assign Your Verse Device**

- In *Verse Explorer*, right-click a folder ‚Üí Create New Verse File (e.g., `timed_objective_example.verse`).
- Create Empty, paste the sample code above, and save.
- Build your Verse file (Verse ‚Üí Build Verse Code or Ctrl+Shift+B).
- In Content Browser, drag your device into the world and assign all references (Objective, buttons).

**4. Test**

- Play the level and interact with the buttons to test all objective phases and ensure events/logs fire.

---

üß† **Tips**

- Combine this device with `end_game_device`, timers, sentries, map indicators, or score managers for complex objectives.
- Use Verse events for extra feedback, spawning, or unlocking further objectives when `Complete` or `End` fires.
- Use per-agent state for PvP or asynchronous player objectives.

‚ùå **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue                      | Possible Reason                       | Solution                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Buttons do nothing         | Device disabled or references not set | Enable device and set all references |
| Events don‚Äôt fire in log   | Not subscribed in Verse code          | Subscribe to all event fields        |
| Wrong teams can use device | Team filters not set                  | Set allowed teams for each action    |

---

üìå **Note:**

- This device is essential for bomb defusal, timed control points, checkpoint races, and speedruns.
- Completion behavior (disable, reset, restart) determines if the objective is one-time or renewable in your game loop.
- For round-based games, combine with `round_settings_device`, `score_manager_device`, and UI feedback for robust control.
