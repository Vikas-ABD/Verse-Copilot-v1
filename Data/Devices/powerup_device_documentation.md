## UEFN Verse Device Documentation: `powerup_device`

### üîπ Description

The `powerup_device` is the foundational class for all powerup-related devices in UEFN, such as health, stat, and effect powerups. It provides the core interface for spawning, granting, and tracking powerup pickups. A key component of this class is the `ItemPickedUpEvent`, which is fired when a player collects the powerup. This class or its subclasses are ideal for creating boost mechanics, timed effects, and stat-modifying pickups.

| `SetMagnitude(float)`       | Sets the effect strength (e.g., health/shield/stat boost).       |
| `GetMagnitude()`            | Retrieves the current effect strength.                           |
| `SetDuration(float)`        | Sets the effect duration in seconds.                             |

| `GetRemainingTime(agent)`   | Returns the remaining time of effect for a specific agent.       |
| `HasEffect(agent)`          | Checks if an agent currently has the effect active.              |
| `IsSpawned()`               | Returns whether the item is currently spawned in the world.      |
| `GetTransform()`            | Gets the item's current transform (position, rotation, scale).   |
| `MoveTo()` / `TeleportTo()` | Moves or teleports the device.                                   |

### üß∞ Verse Usage Example

```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

# Example device showing how to use powerup_device
powerup_device_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    PowerupDevice : health_powerup_device = health_powerup_device{}

    @editable
    SpawnButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        # Subscribe to powerup pickup event
        PowerupDevice.ItemPickedUpEvent.Subscribe(OnPowerupPickedUp)

        # Subscribe to control button
        SpawnButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnSpawnPressed)

    # Event handler for powerup pickup
    OnPowerupPickedUp(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Powerup picked up by agent!")

    # Button control handler
    OnSpawnPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        PowerupDevice.Spawn()
        Print("Powerup spawned!")
```

### How to Use in UEFN

1. **Place Your Powerup Device**

   - From the Content Browser, add a powerup (e.g., `health_powerup`, `stat_powerup`) to your map.

2. **Configure Device**

   - In the Details panel, configure settings such as magnitude, duration, apply target, VFX, and respawn.

3. **(Optional) Add and Configure a Verse Device**

   - In Verse Explorer: Right-click folder ‚Üí Create New Verse File ‚Üí Paste sample code ‚Üí Save.
   - Build Verse Code (Ctrl+Shift+B) until "Build Succeeded".

4. **Assign Devices as @editable References**

   - Select the Verse device and assign `PowerupDevice` and `SpawnButton` in the Details panel.

5. **Test and Iterate**

   - Activate the button to spawn the powerup. Observe pickup behavior and adjust logic as needed.

---

### üß† Best Practices

- Use `SetMagnitude()` and `SetDuration()` for scaling effects or timed buffs.
- Implement advanced behavior such as conditional respawning or UI feedback using Verse scripting.
- Utilize `ItemPickedUpEvent` to trigger rewards, mission progress, or achievements.

| Issue                | Cause/Mistake                       | Solution                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Item doesn‚Äôt spawn   | Did not call `.Spawn()`             | Call `.Spawn()` or enable spawn on start   |
| No event triggers    | Didn‚Äôt `.Subscribe()` to event      | Use `.Subscribe()` for `ItemPickedUpEvent` |
| Config doesn‚Äôt apply | Config set but not saved or applied | Save settings and restart play session     |

### Notes

- Use `powerup_device` directly for generic effects, or subclass for custom logic (e.g., `health_powerup_device`).
- All pickup logic and event handling are unified through `ItemPickedUpEvent` and shared functions.
