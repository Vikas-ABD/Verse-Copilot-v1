### üîç Description
The `sentry_device` generates an AI bot (sentry) that spawns at a set location and will usually attack players when they come in range. Sentries can be configured to target, defend, patrol, or interact with agents and creatures according to your island‚Äôs game logic.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Example Usage in Verse
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

sentry_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    Sentry : sentry_device = sentry_device{}

    @editable
    SpawnButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DestroyButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        SpawnButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnSpawn)
        DestroyButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDestroy)
        Sentry.AlertedEvent.Subscribe(OnAlerted)
        Sentry.AttackingEvent.Subscribe(OnAttacking)
        Sentry.EliminatedEvent.Subscribe(OnEliminated)

    OnSpawn(Agent:agent):void =
        Sentry.Spawn()
        Print("Sentry spawned!")

    OnDestroy(Agent:agent):void =
        Sentry.DestroySentry()
        Print("Sentry destroyed!")

    OnAlerted(AlertingAgent:agent):void =
        Print("Sentry was alerted by a player or agent!")

    OnAttacking(TargetAgent:agent):void =
        Print("Sentry is attacking an agent!")

    OnEliminated(MaybeAgent:?agent):void =
        if (Eliminator := MaybeAgent?):
            Print("Sentry eliminated by agent!")
        else:
            Print("Sentry eliminated by environment or non-agent factor.")
```

### üß† Best Practices
- Set your sentry‚Äôs weapon, team, health, and targeting rules in the Details panel.
- Use events to handle eliminations, attacks, and state transitions for puzzles, arenas, and custom enemy logic.
- For dynamic gameplay, adjust position/team/alert state using Verse or device bindings.

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes & Solutions
| Problem                            | How to Fix                                                                        |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calls device without reference     | Always set `@editable` field and assign in Details pane.                         |
| Sentry does not attack             | Double-check team, range, and targeting rules in Details/device config.          |
| Unmanaged multiple alerts          | Use Verse subscribed events to sequence or debounce custom reactions if needed.  |

### üìÖ Notes
- Use `Pacify()`, `EnableAlert()`, or `Target(Agent)` for advanced sentry behavior controls.
- For zone defense, sequence multiple sentries or combine with trigger/area devices.
