üîπ **Description**

The `fishing_zone_device` enables fishing mechanics in your Fortnite experience. Use it for fishing competitions, collection objectives, or custom minigames featuring fishing as the core activity. This device creates a fishing zone that players can interact with using fishing rods and supports both Battle Royale loot pools and custom loot tables (by dropping items on the device). Advanced game logic can be added by handling fishing events in Verse.

üß∞ **Verse Usage Example**
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

fishing_zone_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    FishingZone : fishing_zone_device = fishing_zone_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    ResetButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    RestockButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        FishingZone.CaughtEvent.Subscribe(OnFishCaught)
        FishingZone.EmptyEvent.Subscribe(OnZoneEmpty)

        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)
        ResetButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnResetPressed)
        RestockButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnRestockPressed)

    OnFishCaught(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Fish caught by player!")

üîß **How it Works in UEFN**

1. **Place Devices in Level**:
   - Add a `fishing_zone_device` in water/lava.
   - Add optional `button_device`s to control the zone.

2. **Configure in Details Panel**:
   - Set usage type, pool type, loot, uses, depletion behavior.
   - Drop loot items on the device for custom pools.

3. **Create & Build Verse Script**:
   - Add a new `.verse` file.
   - Paste the above script.
   - Build via CTRL + SHIFT + B.

4. **Assign Device References**:
   - Assign the `FishingZone` and button references in Details.

5. **Test & Refine**:
   - Use a Fishing Rod to test.
   - Observe events and debug prints.

üß† **Best Practices**
- Use Device Inventory for custom rewards.
- Reset at round start, restock between rounds.
- Enable/Disable based on game phase or triggers.
- Bind to Caught/Empty events for XP, prizes, or tracking.
- Use creative placement‚Äîwater, lava, or props.

‚ùå **Common Mistakes & Fixes**
| Issue | ‚ùå Wrong Usage | ‚úÖ Correct Usage | Explanation |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| No loot when Device Inventory is set | Didn‚Äôt drop items | Drop fish/items on device | Must manually add loot |
| Restock called on wrong Pool Type | Using Battle Royale pool | Use only with Device Inventory | Only applicable for device-managed loot |
| Fishing not working | Never enabled device | Call `.Enable()` | Device must be active |
| Logic not triggering | Didn‚Äôt subscribe to events | Use `.Subscribe(...)` | Events must be handled |

üí° **Additional Notes**
- Multiple devices can support large maps or custom games.
- Combine with boat spawners, item granters, water devices.
- Use Verse or events for competitions, prizes, or tracking rounds.
