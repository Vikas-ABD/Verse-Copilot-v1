### üìô Description
The `conditional_button_device` is a specialized button that players (agents) can only activate if they are carrying specific items in their inventory. This device is commonly used for puzzles, keycards, crafting mechanics, and multi-stage objectives where a player must possess or deliver set items to trigger actions in your Fortnite island.

You can configure:
- Item requirements
- Interaction text and timers
- Visual appearance
- Verse logic or event bindings for full gameplay control

### üß∞ Verse Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

conditional_button_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    ConditionalButton : conditional_button_device = conditional_button_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    SetTextButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    SetTimeButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        ConditionalButton.ActivatedEvent.Subscribe(OnActivated)
        ConditionalButton.NotEnoughItemsEvent.Subscribe(OnNotEnoughItems)
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)
        SetTextButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnSetTextPressed)
        SetTimeButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnSetTimePressed)

    OnActivated(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Conditional button activated by agent!")

    OnNotEnoughItems(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Agent does not have required items!")

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        ConditionalButton.Enable()
        Print("Conditional button enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        ConditionalButton.Disable()
        Print("Conditional button disabled!")

    OnSetTextPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        ConditionalButton.SetInteractionText(StringToMessage("Press with Items"))
        Print("Conditional button interaction text set!")

    OnSetTimePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        ConditionalButton.SetInteractionTime(2.0)
        Print("Conditional button interaction time set to 2.0 seconds!")

    StringToMessage<localizes>(InString : string) : message = "{InString}"
```

### üîÑ Step-by-Step Setup in UEFN
1. **Create the Verse Device**
   - Go to *Verse ‚Üí Verse Explorer* in UEFN.
   - Right-click a folder, select *Create New Verse File* (e.g., `conditional_button_example.verse`).
   - Paste the above code and build (Ctrl+Shift+B).

2. **Place Devices in Your Level**
   - Drag your Verse device from Content Browser into the map.
   - Add a `conditional_button_device` and 4 `button_device` instances.

3. **Assign @editable References**
   - In Details panel:
     - Assign `ConditionalButton`, `EnableButton`, `DisableButton`, `SetTextButton`, `SetTimeButton`.

4. **Configure Conditional Button**
   - Set key item slots and drop items onto the button to register.
   - Adjust interaction time, text, team restrictions, etc.

5. **Test the Logic**
   - Start session, interact as a player with/without required items.
   - Watch log outputs and observe button behavior.

---

### üß† Best Practices
- Limit to 3 key item slots for clarity.
- Physically drop required items on the device to register them.
- Subscribe to both `ActivatedEvent` and `NotEnoughItemsEvent`.
- Combine with item granters, locks, or crafting systems for complex logic.

### ‚ùå Common Issues & Fixes
| Issue | ‚ùå Wrong Example | ‚úÖ Correct Example | Explanation |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Items not assigned | Only set via Verse or UI | Drop items physically onto device | Needed to register them |
| No event subscription | Waiting for action | Use `.Subscribe()` | Required for logic to run |
| Too many items | 4+ items added | Max 3 key item slots | Device limit |
| Button doesn‚Äôt reset | No reactivation | Use `.Reset()` | Needed after activation |
| Blank references | Missing field assignment | Assign in Details panel | Mandatory for Verse to function |

---

**Note:** For more advanced systems (e.g., crafting or delivery), combine multiple conditional buttons and chain logic through Verse scripting to control progression and unlocks.
