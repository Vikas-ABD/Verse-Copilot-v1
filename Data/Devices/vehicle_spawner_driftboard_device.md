| Function Name       | Description                                                             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enable()            | Enables the spawner so that the Driftboard can be spawned.              |
| Disable()           | Disables the spawner, preventing new spawns.                            |
| RespawnVehicle()    | Destroys the current Driftboard and spawns a new one.                   |
| DestroyVehicle()    | Destroys the currently spawned Driftboard (if it exists).               |
| AssignDriver(agent) | Assigns a player to the Driftboard as the driver.                       |
| GetTransform()      | Returns the spawner‚Äôs position, rotation, and scale. Use IsValid() check first. |
| MoveTo(Position, Rotation, Duration) | Smoothly moves the spawner to a new location.           |
| MoveTo(Transform, Duration)         | Moves the spawner using a full transform struct.         |
| TeleportTo(...)     | Instantly teleports the spawner to a given position/rotation.           |

üß∞ **Verse Usage Example**

This sample Verse script spawns a Driftboard on game start and prints messages when players get on or off the board:
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }

driftboard_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    DriftboardSpawner : vehicle_spawner_driftboard_device = vehicle_spawner_driftboard_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        DriftboardSpawner.AgentEntersVehicleEvent.Subscribe(OnEnter)
        DriftboardSpawner.AgentExitsVehicleEvent.Subscribe(OnExit)

        DriftboardSpawner.Enable()
        DriftboardSpawner.RespawnVehicle()

    OnEnter(Player : agent) : void =
        Print("Player entered the Driftboard: {Player}")

    OnExit(Player : agent) : void =
        Print("Player exited the Driftboard: {Player}")
```

üîß **How to Use in UEFN**

1. **Place the Device**
    - Add a `vehicle_spawner_driftboard_device` to your level from the Devices panel.

2. **Configure Options**
    - Adjust speed, jump, boost, or respawn settings via the Details panel.

3. **Create a Verse Script**
    - Use the script above or write custom logic for Driftboard interactions.

4. **Assign Device Reference**
    - In your Verse device's Details panel, link `DriftboardSpawner` to the placed spawner.

5. **Build and Test**
    - Compile Verse (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) and test player interaction in your experience.

üß† **Best Practices**

- Use `AssignDriver()` to auto-place players on the Driftboard, such as after pressing a button or entering a trigger.
- Pair with `vehicle_mod_box_spawner_device` to let players mod their Driftboard mid-game.
- Use `DestroyedEvent` to respawn automatically or trigger consequences (like losing a life or restarting a lap).

‚ùå **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue                        | Problem ‚ùå              | Solution ‚úÖ                                       |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Driftboard doesn‚Äôt spawn    | Device disabled         | Use `Enable()` before `RespawnVehicle()`         |
| Agent doesn‚Äôt mount         | Driver not assigned     | Use `AssignDriver(agent)`                        |
| No feedback on interaction  | Events not subscribed   | Use `.Subscribe()` in `OnBegin()`                |
| Driftboard stuck/misplaced  | Transform issues        | Use `TeleportTo()` to reposition reliably        |

üìé **Note**

The Driftboard is agile and fast, making it ideal for traversal, racing, trick systems, or hover-based gameplay. If you want to add boost pads, timed challenges, or vehicle health tracking, let me know ‚Äî I can help build that with Verse logic!
