üõ†Ô∏è **Verse Usage Example**

```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

elimination_manager_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    EliminationManager : elimination_manager_device = elimination_manager_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        EliminationManager.EliminatedEvent.Subscribe(OnElimination)
        EliminationManager.ItemPickedUpEvent.Subscribe(OnItemPickedUp)

    OnElimination(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Agent eliminated - spawning items!")

    OnItemPickedUp(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Item picked up by agent!")
```

**Explanation:**

- Subscribes to `EliminatedEvent` and `ItemPickedUpEvent`.
- Executes `OnElimination` when a qualifying target is eliminated.
- Executes `OnItemPickedUp` when item is collected by an agent.
- All item behavior (what drops, randomness, etc.) is configured in UEFN.

üí™ **How to Set Up in UEFN**

1. **Place Devices in Level**

   - Add `elimination_manager_device` in scene.
   - Drop desired items on device to register them.

2. **Configure Options (Details Panel)**

   - Set target type, drop number, motion, spawn radius, etc.
   - Set random drop rules, drop chance, and team/class filters.

3. **Create & Build Verse Script**

   - In Verse Explorer: Create new file (e.g., `elimination_manager_example.verse`).
   - Paste example code and build (Ctrl+Shift+B).

4. **Place and Reference Your Verse Device**

   - Drag `elimination_manager_example` Verse device into world.
   - Assign `EliminationManager` in the Details panel.

5. **Test & Iterate**

   - Test eliminations to verify item drops and pickup logic.
   - Use logs to confirm events are triggered.

üß† **Best Practices**

- For <100% drop chance, communicate rarity to players.
- Pair with device signals/channels for quests or objectives.
- Use `ItemPickedUpEvent` to reward or update player progress.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Drop not active           | Didn't assign items in editor  | Physically assign/drop items on device   | Must register items before runtime                 |
| Not subscribing to events | No event triggered             | Use `.Subscribe(...)` in Verse           | Required for logic to respond to game events       |
| Device not enabled        | "Enabled At Game Start" is off | Set to On or call `.Enable()` in Verse   | Device must be active                              |
| Over-restrictive filters  | Testing with wrong target type | Match filters to test scenario           | Drops only occur for selected targets              |
| Missing reference         | Left `@editable` field blank   | Assign device reference in Details panel | Verse script needs reference to function correctly |

üìÖ **Note:**

- Ideal for loot-based, progression, and collectathon games.
- Dropped items must be pre-registered per session.
- Combine with Verse and gameplay systems for powerful results.
