## ball_spawner_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

### üîπ Description
The `ball_spawner_device` is used to spawn various ball types (such as generic ball, beach ball) for interactive games and mechanics like dodgeball, soccer, capture zones, and more. It allows control over ball physics, size, color, respawning behavior, and HUD markers. You can spawn, enable/disable, and show/hide HUD markers using Verse logic or Creative wiring.

### üß± Verse Using Statement

### üß∞ Verse Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

# Example device showing how to use ball_spawner_device with button controls
ball_spawner_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    BallSpawner : ball_spawner_device = ball_spawner_device{}

    @editable
    SpawnButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    ShowHUDButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    HideHUDButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        # Subscribe to button events
        SpawnButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnSpawnPressed)
        ShowHUDButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnShowHUDPressed)
        HideHUDButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnHideHUDPressed)

    # Button control handlers
    OnSpawnPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        BallSpawner.Enable()
        Print("Ball spawner enabled!")

    OnShowHUDPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        BallSpawner.ShowHUD()
        Print("Ball HUD shown!")

    OnHideHUDPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        BallSpawner.HideHUD()
        Print("Ball HUD hidden!")
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è How it Works in UEFN
1. **Place Devices in Level**:
   - Drag a `ball_spawner_device` into the map.
   - Add any `button_devices` for runtime control.
2. **Configure Options (Details Panel)**:
   - Set ball type, size, color, gravity, respawn behavior, etc.
   - Enable ‚ÄúEliminate Player When Touched‚Äù if needed.
3. **Create & Build Verse Script**:
   - Create new Verse file (e.g., `ball_spawner_example.verse`).
   - Paste example code, save.
   - Click Verse ‚Üí Build Verse Code or press CTRL+SHIFT+B.
4. **Place & Reference Verse Device**:
   - Drag `ball_spawner_example` into the island.
   - Assign `BallSpawner`, `SpawnButton`, `ShowHUDButton`, and `HideHUDButton` via Details panel.
5. **Test Gameplay**:
   - Use buttons to enable/disable the spawner and toggle HUD icons. Ball spawns per settings.

### üß† Best Practices
- Combine with elimination zones for dodgeball/soccer/puzzle games.
- Use `.ShowHUD()` and `.HideHUD()` for on-demand guidance.
- Tweak Ball Size and Gravity for gameplay variety.
- Use elimination on contact for instant-elimination modes.
- Combine with Zone/Capture Area devices for complex logic.

### ‚ùå Incorrect Usage & How to Fix
| Issue | ‚ùå Wrong Example | ‚úÖ Correct Example | Explanation |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Not calling Enable() | Placed but didn‚Äôt call `.Enable()` | `BallSpawner.Enable()` | Balls only spawn when enabled. |
| Wiring HUD directly | Wired ShowHUD, no effect | `BallSpawner.ShowHUD()` | Must be triggered via Verse/event. |
| Unassigned device refs | Left BallSpawner blank | Assign in Details panel | All @editable refs must be linked. |
| No elimination config | Ball didn‚Äôt eliminate players | Set "Eliminate Player When Touched" to On | Must configure in Details panel. |
| Runtime color/size | Tried `BallSpawner.SetColor()` | Set color/size in Details panel | Not configurable via Verse methods. |

### üîπ Note
- This device does not support spawning custom static meshes or coins.
- Use only for supported ball games.
- For advanced mechanics, combine with triggers, captures, and HUD cues.
