### üß∞ Verse Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Fortnite.com/Vehicles }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

helicopter_vehicle_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    HelicopterSpawner : vehicle_spawner_helicopter_device = vehicle_spawner_helicopter_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    RespawnButton : button_device = button_device{}

    var CurrentVehicle : ?fort_vehicle = false

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        HelicopterSpawner.SpawnedEvent.Subscribe(OnVehicleSpawned)
        HelicopterSpawner.DestroyedEvent.Subscribe(OnVehicleDestroyed)
        HelicopterSpawner.AgentEntersVehicleEvent.Subscribe(OnAgentEntersVehicle)
        HelicopterSpawner.AgentExitsVehicleEvent.Subscribe(OnAgentExitsVehicle)

        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)
        RespawnButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnRespawnPressed)

    OnVehicleSpawned(Vehicle : fort_vehicle) : void =
        set CurrentVehicle = option{Vehicle}
        Print("Helicopter spawned!")

    OnVehicleDestroyed() : void =
        set CurrentVehicle = false
        Print("Helicopter destroyed!")

    OnAgentEntersVehicle(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Agent entered Helicopter!")

    OnAgentExitsVehicle(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Agent exited Helicopter!")

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        HelicopterSpawner.Enable()
        Print("Helicopter spawner enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        HelicopterSpawner.Disable()
        Print("Helicopter spawner disabled!")

    OnRespawnPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        HelicopterSpawner.RespawnVehicle()
        Print("Helicopter respawned!")
```

### How to Use in UEFN
1. **Place Devices in Your Level**
   - Drag in a `vehicle_spawner_helicopter_device`
   - Optionally add three `button_device` instances for Enable, Disable, Respawn

2. **Configure Helicopter in Details Panel**
   - Choose color, seats, handling, HP, and spawn/destroy rules

3. **Create and Add Your Verse Script**
   - In *Verse Explorer*, right-click a folder ‚Üí Create New Verse File (e.g., `helicopter_vehicle_example.verse`)
   - Paste the code, save, and build the script (Ctrl+Shift+B)
   - Drag your Verse device into the world

4. **Assign @editable References**
   - Assign the helicopter device to `HelicopterSpawner`
   - Set each button field to your placed `button_device`

5. **Test Thoroughly In-Game**
   - Use buttons to control, check logs for event messages

### üß† Best Practices
- Use vehicle events to lock, eliminate, or assign drivers programmatically
- Combine with triggers, timers, volumes, or objectives for complex sequences (air drops, rescues, etc.)
- Customize HP, damage, appearance for unique mechanics or cinematic effects

### ‚ùå Common Issues & Fixes
| Issue | ‚ùå Problem | ‚úÖ Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Helicopter not spawning | Device not enabled or "Spawn When Enabled" is off | Call `.Enable()` or enable auto-spawn |
| No event output in Verse | Not subscribed in `OnBegin` | Ensure `.Subscribe(...)` is used |
| Reference errors in Verse | `@editable` values not set | Assign references in Details panel, then build |
| Immediate destroy on disable | "Destroy on Disable" is on | Adjust this setting in Details panel |

### Note
- All standard vehicle elimination, entry/exit, assignment, and cosmetic options are supported.
- Use Verse to script any logic for missions, sequences, scoring, or effects involving the helicopter.
