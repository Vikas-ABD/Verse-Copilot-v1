| `MoveTo(Position, Rotation, Duration)` | Smoothly moves the device to a new position.                         |
| `MoveTo(Transform, Duration)`   | Moves the device using a full transform struct.                          |
| `TeleportTo(...)`              | Instantly moves the device to a new location.                            |

### üß∞ Verse Usage Example
Here‚Äôs a simple script that spawns the powerup at game start and logs when a player picks it up:
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }

powerup_effect_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    VFXPowerup : visual_effect_powerup_device = visual_effect_powerup_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        VFXPowerup.ItemPickedUpEvent.Subscribe(OnPickedUp)
        VFXPowerup.Spawn()

    OnPickedUp(Player : agent) : void =
        Print("Powerup picked up by: {Player}")
```

### üîß How to Use in UEFN
1. **Place the Device**
    - Drag a `visual_effect_powerup_device` into your level.
2. **Configure Details**
    - Set "Apply To", "Effect Duration", and "Effect Type" (e.g. glow, outline) in the Details panel.
3. **Optional: Add Verse Logic**
    - Create custom scripts for events like pickups.
4. **Build and Test**
    - Compile Verse (Ctrl+Shift+B), test interactions and effect behavior in-game.

### üß† Best Practices
- Use `Pickup(Agent)` to manually assign effects via buttons or triggers.
- Combine the effect with score boosts, ability unlocks, or UI prompts.
- Use `HasEffect()` and `GetRemainingTime()` to track and manage stateful logic.

### ‚ùå Common Issues & Solutions

| Effect is permanent/too long | Duration misconfigured                        | Use `SetDuration()` or adjust in Details           |
| Players can‚Äôt pick up    | Pickup range or collision setup                | Adjust placement or pickup radius                  |

### üìé Note
This device is **visual only**‚Äîit does not affect player stats or gameplay functionality by default. For stat-based powerups (e.g., speed, shield), use appropriate powerup device types or integrate with logic devices.
