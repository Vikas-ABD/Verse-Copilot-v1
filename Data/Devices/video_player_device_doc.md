using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

video_player_example := class(creative_device):

        VideoPlayer.Enable()
        Print("Video player enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        VideoPlayer.Disable()
        Print("Video player disabled!")

    OnFullscreenPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Fullscreen mode is not supported by video_player_device.")

    OnPiPPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Picture-in-picture mode is not supported by video_player_device.")

    RestartVideo() : void =
        VideoPlayer.Restart()
        Print("Video restarted!")

    SeekVideo() : void =
        VideoPlayer.Seek()
        Print("Video seeked to beginning!")

    TakeControl() : void =
        VideoPlayer.TakeControl()
        Print("Control taken for video player!")

üõ† How it works in UEFN
1. **Place Devices in Level**
   - Add a video_player_device and a screen from the Devices tab or Galleries.
   - Add control button_devices for interaction.

2. **Configure Device in Details Panel**
   - Assign video source, HUD or screen display, autoplay, loop, controls, and collision.

3. **Add & Build the Verse Script**
   - Create a Verse file (e.g., `video_player_example.verse`).
   - Paste the script and build using `CTRL+SHIFT+B` until "Build Succeeded".

4. **Place & Reference Devices**
   - Drag the script class into the world.
   - In the Details panel, assign references for VideoPlayer and buttons.

5. **Test in Play Session**
   - Interact with buttons in-game to enable, disable, or simulate modes.

üß† Best Practices
- Use `.Enable()` and `.Disable()` for event-driven playback.
- Handle `StreamStartedEvent` for synchronized gameplay actions.
- Combine with HUD and UI logic for immersive experience.
- Adjust collision and display settings for intended gameplay effects.

| Video doesn't play      | Device not enabled / autoplay off         | Call `.Enable()` or enable Autoplay          | Must trigger playback                      |
| Fullscreen/PiP fails    | Missing agent in method call              | Use `EnterFullScreen(agent)` etc.            | Agent context required                     |
| Device unresponsive     | Device references not assigned in Verse   | Assign in Details panel                      | Devices won‚Äôt respond otherwise            |
| Video not visible       | Unapproved or missing video source        | Select from curated list in Details panel    | Only approved videos are supported         |

üìå Note:
- Only curated videos are supported, not arbitrary uploads.
- Use per-agent methods for HUD/video control.
- Integrate with gameplay logic for advanced use cases like tutorials or cutscenes.
