# üìò physics_tree_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

## üîπ Description
The `physics_tree_device` is a physics-based, interactive tree designed for Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) experiences. It can be chopped down by players, falling and transforming into a log that interacts with the world using physics. Both the log and stump can be destroyed, and all parts can deal configurable damage to players, vehicles, creatures, and structures on impact. This tree is ideal for dynamic hazards, puzzles, and creative interactive environments.

## üîß How to Set Up in UEFN
1. **Place Devices in Your Level**
   - Drag one `physics_tree_device` and five `button_device`s into your world.
2. **Configure Tree/Buttons**
   - Adjust tree damage, health, respawn, and spawn options in the Details panel.
   - Label buttons appropriately: Enable, Disable, Spawn, DestroyAll, ReleaseLog.
3. **Create and Add Verse Script**
   - In Verse Explorer, right-click a folder ‚Üí *Create New Verse File*.
   - Paste the example code and save.
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+B to Build Verse Code.
   - Drag the Verse device into the world.
4. **Assign @editable References**
   - Link Tree and each Button to their respective placed devices.
5. **Test In-Game**
   - Launch a session and test tree interaction via buttons and event logs.

## üß† Best Practices
- Use event subscriptions to react dynamically (score, elimination, puzzle progress).
- Use `DestroyAllSpawnedObjects()` for resets.
- Use `ReleaseLog()` for puzzle logic or triggered hazards.
- Adjust damage/health settings for gameplay balance.

|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tree/log does not spawn/respawn | Wrong Details config          | Set respawn timers, health, enable spawn    | Tree must be enabled and configured to spawn     |
| Log/tree/stump indestructible   | Health set to Indestructible | Lower health in Details panel               | Set destructible values for interaction          |
| Events don‚Äôt fire in Verse       | No event subscription         | Add event subscriptions in `OnBegin()`      | Required for reactive logic                      |
| Reference error in Verse        | @editable not assigned        | Assign in Details panel                     | Devices must be linked to Verse via @editable    |

> **Note:** Damage scales with physics impact. All parts are indestructible by default. Change this in the Details panel.
