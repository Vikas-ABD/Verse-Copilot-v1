| `Enable()`           | Enables the device, allowing vehicles to spawn.                          |
| `Disable()`          | Disables the device and prevents spawns.                                |
| `RespawnVehicle()`   | Destroys any current Mudflap and spawns a new one.                       |
| `DestroyVehicle()`   | Destroys the spawned Mudflap.                                            |
| `AssignDriver(agent)`| Forces the specified agent to enter the truck as the driver.            |
| `GetTransform()`     | Returns the transform of the spawner. Requires `IsValid()` check first. |
| `MoveTo(Position, Rotation, Duration)` | Smoothly moves the spawner to a new position and rotation. |
| `MoveTo(Transform, Duration)` | Moves the spawner using a full transform.                  |
| `TeleportTo(...)`    | Instantly relocates the spawner to a new position/rotation.             |

## ü™† Verse Usage Example
This example spawns the Mudflap on game start and logs vehicle entry and exit:
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }

big_rig_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    BigRigSpawner : vehicle_spawner_big_rig_device = vehicle_spawner_big_rig_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        BigRigSpawner.AgentEntersVehicleEvent.Subscribe(OnEnter)
        BigRigSpawner.AgentExitsVehicleEvent.Subscribe(OnExit)

        BigRigSpawner.Enable()
        BigRigSpawner.RespawnVehicle()

    OnEnter(Player : agent) : void =
        Print("Player entered the Mudflap: {Player}")

    OnExit(Player : agent) : void =
        Print("Player exited the Mudflap: {Player}")
```
