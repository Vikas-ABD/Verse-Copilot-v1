## UEFN Verse Device Documentation: `player_marker_device`

### üîπ Description
The `player_marker_device` is used to mark agents (players) in the world, displaying their location on the minimap and optionally attaching custom visual data such as health bars, shield bars, distance, custom icons, and labels.

#### Common Use Cases
- Team role indicators (e.g., VIP, Medic, Leader)
- Bounty-style tracking or escort objectives
- Co-op gameplay feedback (e.g., showing distance to allies)
- Puzzle/quest design (e.g., follow the marked player)

Markers can be dynamically attached or detached using Verse. The device also supports item tracking that fires events based on inventory conditions.

### üö¶ Common Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }

marker_example := class(
    @editable Marker: player_marker_device
):

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends>: void =
        Marker.Enable()

    MarkPlayer(Player: agent): void =
        Marker.Attach(Player)

    UnmarkPlayer(Player: agent): void =
        Marker.Detach(Player)
```

---

### üß† Best Practices
- Use `Attach()` when players enter a tracked state (e.g., VIP, bounty target).
- Use `FirstItemValueReachedEvent` to trigger gameplay logic.
- Pair with `hud_message_device` or `elimination_feed_device` for announcements.
- Use `DetachFromAll()` to clear markers at round end or upon player elimination.
- Configure visibility for tactical gameplay or puzzle mechanics.

### ‚ùå Incorrect Usage Examples and Fixes
| Issue                          | ‚ùå Wrong         | ‚úÖ Fix                            | Explanation                                                         |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Forgetting to call `Attach()` | Marker doesn't appear | Call `Attach()` after enabling     | Must explicitly attach the agent in Verse.                          |
| Calling before `Enable()`     | Marker doesn‚Äôt display | Enable the device first           | Device must be enabled to show markers.                            |
| Passing `none` to `Attach()`  | `Attach(none)`     | Pass a valid agent                 | Must always pass a valid player/agent.                             |
| Expecting prop to be marked   | Marks a world prop | Use only with agents/players       | Device is for agent tracking only, not objects or actors.           |
