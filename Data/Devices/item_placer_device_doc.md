# item_placer_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

## üìô Description
The `item_placer_device` lets you place a pickup item or weapon directly in your Fortnite island, appearing naturally in the world rather than dropping from the sky or a chest. The device acts as a container: when a player interacts with the visual item, it grants that registered item to the player. If the item placer is destroyed (e.g., mounted on a destructible object), the item will drop to the ground.

Use this device for:
- Precise item placement
- Realism
- Custom spawn behavior
- Static loot locations

# Example: Controlling item placer device
item_placer_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    ItemPlacer : item_placer_device = item_placer_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        ItemPlacer.Enable()
        Print("Item placer enabled")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        ItemPlacer.Disable()
        Print("Item placer disabled")
```

**Explanation:**
- Place an `item_placer_device` in your level, and use the Details panel to register the item/weapon you want to appear.
- You can connect Verse code (above) to enable or disable the device via button triggers or custom game logic.
- When enabled, players who meet the team or class restrictions and interact with the visual item (after the interact time) will receive the registered item in their inventory.

## ü™∞ Best Practices
- Always register the desired item in the item placer before playtesting‚Äîopen Details, assign, and confirm.
- Use clear "Interact Text" for instructions, especially with unusual or custom items.
- For limited pickups, set Allow Respawn to Off; for recurring or campaign items, enable respawn.
- Combine with destructible props for hidden, trap, or reward loot setups.
- Use team/class restrictions for role-based gameplay or competitive balance.

## ‚ùå Incorrect Usage Examples and How to Fix
| Issue | ‚ùå Wrong Example | ‚úÖ Correct Example | Explanation |
|-------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| No `@editable` reference | Code uses device w/o assignment | Reference and assign in Details panel | Prevents null/error calls in Verse |
| Interact Time too long/short | Setting to 0 (no time) or 60s | Choose an intuitive hold time (0.5s‚Äì3s typical) | Better player experience |
| Not registering any item | Device unconfigured | Set item in Details panel before play/test | No item appears unless chosen |

**Note:**
- The item is visible as an in-world pickup; if destroyed, it drops; if collected, it despawns (and respawns, if allowed).
- Works for all standard Fortnite weapons and most consumables or key items supported in UEFN.
- Powerful for static loot, advanced level design, and special choreographed encounters.
