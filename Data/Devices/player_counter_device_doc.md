# player\_counter\_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

## üîπ Description

The `player_counter_device` is used to track the number of players within a defined area and react dynamically in-game based on that count. It is ideal for gameplay scenarios where logic depends on player presence, such as:

- Group doors
- Team-based puzzles
- Co-op events
- Win/loss conditions

The device can optionally display a visible info panel showing current and required player counts, and it emits events when the count changes or matches the configured target.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options (Details Panel)

- **Target Player Count**: Number of players required to trigger success.
- **Track Registered Players**: Whether to count by registration or live presence.
- **Count Display Enabled**: Enables visual count display panel.
- **Check Frequency**: Frequency of count checks against the target.
- **Class / Team Restrictions**: Filter counted players by team or class.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Common Usage: Step-by-Step Example

```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }

team_gate_controller := class(
    @editable PlayerCounter: player_counter_device
):

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends>: void =
        PlayerCounter.Enable()
        PlayerCounter.CountSucceedsEvent.Subscribe(OnAllPlayersPresent)
        PlayerCounter.CountFailsEvent.Subscribe(OnNotEnoughPlayers)

    OnAllPlayersPresent(): void =
        Print("All players present! Opening gate...")

    OnNotEnoughPlayers(): void =
        Print("Waiting for more players...")
```

## üß∞ Usage Example

```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

player_counter_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    PlayerCounter : player_counter_device = player_counter_device{}
    @editable
    DoorDevice : creative_device = creative_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        PlayerCounter.CountSucceedsEvent.Subscribe(OnTargetCountReached)
        PlayerCounter.CountFailsEvent.Subscribe(OnTargetCountFailed)
        PlayerCounter.CountedEvent.Subscribe(OnPlayerCounted)

    OnTargetCountReached() : void =
        Print("Target number of players reached!")
        DoorDevice.Enable()

    OnTargetCountFailed() : void =
        Print("Not enough players present!")
        DoorDevice.Disable()

    OnPlayerCounted(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Player entered area and was counted!")
```

## üß† Best Practices

- Set comparison mode (equal, greater than, etc.) carefully
- Use team/class filters for co-op or versus mechanics
- Display info panel for player feedback
- Chain with `Enable()`, `SetTargetCount()`, `ShowInfoPanel()` for dynamic logic
- Combine with:
  - `barrier_device` for gate control
  - `hud_message_device` to show entry/exit prompts
  - `trigger_device` to enable counting only in key areas

## ‚ùå Incorrect Usage Examples and Fixes

| Issue                              | ‚ùå Wrong Example             | ‚úÖ Correct Example                         | Explanation                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| No `@editable` assignment          | Device unassigned           | Assign via `@editable` in Details panel   | Prevents null errors         |
| Missing Compare Mode               | Compare mode left unset     | Set to appropriate logic (Equal, etc.)    | No events will trigger       |
| Not Subscribing to Events          | No `Subscribe()` called     | Subscribe to events in `OnBegin`          | Required for event handling  |
| Calling GetCount() before Enable() | `GetCount()` fails silently | Always call `Enable()` first              | Device not active yet        |
| Expecting auto target updates      | Target count never changes  | Use `SetTargetCount()` or adjust manually | Dynamic updates require code |

## üåü Great For:

- Puzzle or boss fights requiring multiple players
- Group-based doors or platforms
- Co-op mechanics and escape rooms
- Dynamic team logic gates
- Custom respawn or checkpoint areas
