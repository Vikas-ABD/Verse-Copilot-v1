matchmaking_portal_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    MatchmakingPortal : matchmaking_portal_device = matchmaking_portal_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        MatchmakingPortal.Enable()
        Print("Matchmaking portal enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        MatchmakingPortal.Disable()
