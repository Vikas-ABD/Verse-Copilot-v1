üìò shooting\_range\_target\_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

üîπ Description The shooting\_range\_target\_device is a customizable pop-up target that can be hit by agents (players or AI) to trigger various events. It is useful for shooting galleries, aim practice, challenges, and minigames. This device supports pop-up/pop-down states, can be moved (hop up/down), and can signal events for hits, bullseyes, knockdowns, and more. All main functions and events can be accessed and controlled using Verse.

ü•à Events Usage Subscribe in Verse to respond to events such as hits, bullseyes, knockdowns, etc. For example, you can award points, pop targets down/up, or add custom effects when a target is hit.

üõ†Ô∏è Verse Usage Example

```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

shooting_range_target_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    Target : shooting_range_target_device = shooting_range_target_device{}

    @editable
    ResetButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        # Subscribe to hit and knockdown events
        Target.HitEvent.Subscribe(OnTargetHit)
        Target.KnockdownEvent.Subscribe(OnTargetKnockedDown)
        Target.BullseyeHitEvent.Subscribe(OnBullseyeHit)

        ResetButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnResetPressed)

        # (Optional) Pop up at game start
        Target.PopUp()

    # Event handlers
    OnTargetHit() : void =
        Print("Target was hit!")
        Target.HopUp()

    OnTargetKnockedDown() : void =
        Print("Target knocked down! Popping down target.")
        Target.PopDown()

    OnBullseyeHit() : void =
        Print("Bullseye hit!")

    # Reset handler
    OnResetPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        Target.Reset()
        Print("Target reset")
```

Explanation:

- Reference your target device and a button for resets.
- Subscribes in Verse to HitEvent, KnockdownEvent, and BullseyeHitEvent.
- Pops up at start, hops up on any hit, pops down on knockdown, and gives a special log/message for bullseye hits.
- Button press triggers a reset.

How to Use in UEFN:

1. Place the Target Device
   - Drag one or more shooting\_range\_target\_device objects into your level.
2. Configure Options
   - Set health, scoring, reset, and FX options in the Details panel.
3. (Optional) Place Control Button(s)
   - Add button(s) for in-game target reset or extra control in your minigame.
4. Create a Verse Device
   - In Verse Explorer: Right click ‚Üí Create New Verse File (e.g., shooting\_range\_target\_example.verse).
   - Create Empty, paste the code shown above, and save.
   - Click Verse ‚Üí Build Verse Code (Ctrl+Shift+B) until ‚ÄúBuild Succeeded‚Äù.
5. Assign All Device References
   - In the Details panel, assign:
     - Target ‚Üí your shooting\_range\_target\_device
     - ResetButton ‚Üí (optional) button\_device for manual resets
6. Test Your Experience
   - Play, shoot, and interact with the target to confirm all events work as expected.

üß† Best Practices

- Combine multiple targets with scoring devices for aim challenges and shooting galleries.
- Use Verse events to create custom effects, advanced logic, or player feedback.
- Set appropriate reset and score options for your game‚Äôs difficulty and pacing.
