## item_remover_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

### üîπ Description
The `item_remover_device` allows you to remove items from a player‚Äôs inventory, either by forcing them to drop or permanently deleting them. It can be used to simulate item loss, loot drops, or inventory clearing in response to specific gameplay events such as a player being Down But Not Out (DBNO), eliminated, or entering a restricted zone.

This device is essential for game modes where risk, penalty, or item transfer is part of the gameplay loop (e.g., extraction shooters, PvPvE, or survival games).

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Usage: Step-by-Step Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }

item_drop_handler := class(
    @editable ItemRemover: item_remover_device
)

OnBegin<override>() :=
    ItemRemover.Enable()

ForceDropItems(Player: agent): void =
    if (ItemRemover.IsEnabled()):
        ItemRemover.RemoveItems(Player)
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Usage Example 2
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

item_remover_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    ItemRemover : item_remover_device = item_remover_device{}

    @editable
    DBNODevice : down_but_not_out_device = down_but_not_out_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        DBNODevice.AgentDownedEvent.Subscribe(OnPlayerDowned)
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

    OnPlayerDowned(Agent : agent) : void =
        ItemRemover.RemoveItems(Agent)
        Print("Items removed from downed player")

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        ItemRemover.Enable()
        Print("Item remover enabled")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        ItemRemover.Disable()
        Print("Item remover disabled")
```

### üß† Best Practices
* Carefully set "Affected Objects" (e.g., only weapons, building resources, or all).
* Use "Drop Items" for loot mechanics; "Remove Items" for penalty mechanics.
* Use "Apply To" settings for team/class-wide effects.
* Pair with `down_but_not_out_device` or similar event triggers.
* Combine with `elimination_feed_device` or UI indicators for clarity.

| No items removed              | Not configuring "Affected Objects"| Select correct options in Details panel     | Device won't affect anything otherwise                |
| Calling before enabling       | Calling `RemoveItems()` directly  | Always call `Enable()` before removing      | Device must be enabled to perform operations          |

### üöÄ Great For:
* Inventory loss in PvPvE or DBNO scenarios
* Extract-or-lose mechanics
