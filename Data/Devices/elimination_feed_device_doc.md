### üß∞ Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

# Device to send custom messages to the elimination feed
elimination_feed_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    EliminationFeed : elimination_feed_device = elimination_feed_device{}

    @editable
    FeedButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        # Subscribe to button interaction
        FeedButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnButtonPressed)

    # Send custom elimination feed message when button is pressed
    OnButtonPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        EliminationFeed.Activate(Agent)
        Print("Custom elimination feed message sent!")
```

#### Explanation:
- Place both an `elimination_feed_device` and a `button_device` in your level.
- Assign the `elimination_feed_device` and `button_device` to the respective `@editable` variables in the Details panel.
- Configure message, color, icon, and visibility in the `elimination_feed_device`'s Details panel.
- When the button is pressed, the configured message will be sent to the elimination feed, attributed to the player.

---

### üß† Best Practices
- Keep messages short, clear, and visually distinct.
- Use color and icons to improve message visibility.
- Use visibility and team/class restrictions for targeted gameplay scenarios.
- Suitable for eliminations, captures, power-ups, objectives, and other key events.

### ‚ùå Incorrect Usage Examples and Fixes
| Issue | ‚ùå Wrong Example | ‚úÖ Correct Example | Explanation |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Not assigning device reference | `Activate()` without assignment | Assign in Details panel as `@editable` | Prevents nil/error access to device |
| Incorrect argument | `Activate(player)` | `Activate(Agent)` as provided to handler | Must use a valid agent object |
| Message not showing | Device not enabled/configured | Use `Enable()` and configure all message options | Device must be enabled and properly set up |

#### Notes:
- Message display may vary based on team/class/visibility settings.
- The device does **not** auto-detect eliminations‚Äîyou must explicitly call `Activate()` during events or use triggers.
- Use multiple instances for different messages or events.
