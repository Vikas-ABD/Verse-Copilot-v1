# pinball_flipper_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

## üîπ Description
The `pinball_flipper_device` is used to move, damage, and give scores to players that interact with it. By default, it is activated when any player touches its front face: the device rotates (counterclockwise by default), knocks players upward and away, deals optional damage, and can award in-game points. Flippers are ideal for pinball-style gameplay, arcade arenas, or creative movement and scoring mechanics.

### Explanation:
- References one `pinball_flipper_device` and three `button_device`s for enable, disable, and activate.
- Subscribes buttons to control functions.
- Each button toggles the flipper behavior through Verse.
- Device's native proximity activation is set via the Details panel.
