## carryable_spawner_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

### üîπ Description
The `carryable_spawner_device` is used to spawn a carryable object into your Fortnite experience. Carryables are interactive objects that players can pick up, carry, throw, drop, or cause to explode.

This device provides fine control over the carryable‚Äôs behavior, including damage values, explosion settings, pickup/drop/throw detection, and force-carry functionality. It‚Äôs ideal for:
- Delivery objectives
- Interactive game items
- Explosive payloads
- Puzzle mechanics

### üß∞ Core Methods
| Method Signature | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `Spawn(): void` | Spawns the carryable if it doesn't exist |
| `Despawn(): void` | Removes it if it exists |
| `Explode(): void` | Triggers explosion |
| `Explode(Instigator: agent): void` | Explodes with specific instigator |
| `ForcePlayerToCarry(Player: agent): void` | Forces player to pick it up |
| `Enable(): void` | Enables the spawner |
| `Disable(): void` | Disables the spawner and despawns it |
| `IsEnabled(): logic` | Returns true if device is enabled |
| `IsSpawned(): logic` | Returns true if carryable exists |
| `GetTransform(): transform` | Gets device‚Äôs transform (check IsValid()) |
| `MoveTo(Position: vector3, Rotation: rotation, Time: float): void` | Smoothly moves to new position/rotation |
| `MoveTo(TargetTransform: transform, Time: float): void` | Moves to full transform |
| `TeleportTo(Position: vector3, Rotation: rotation): void` | Instantly teleports |
| `TeleportTo(TargetTransform: transform): void` | Instantly moves/rotates using transform |

### üö¶ Common Usage: Step-by-Step Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }

carryable_controller := class(
    @editable CarryableSpawner: carryable_spawner_device
):

    OnBegin<override>() :=
        CarryableSpawner.Enable()
        CarryableSpawner.Spawn()
        CarryableSpawner.PickUpEvent.Subscribe(OnPickedUp)
        CarryableSpawner.ExplodeEvent.Subscribe(OnExploded)

    OnPickedUp(Player: agent): void =
        Print("Carryable picked up by: {Player}")

    OnExploded(Info: tuple(Instigator: agent, Affected: []agent)): void =
        Print("Carryable exploded by: {Info.Instigator}")
```

### ‚ùå Incorrect Usage Examples and How to Fix
| Issue | ‚ùå Wrong | ‚úÖ Fix |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Spawning twice | `CarryableSpawner.Spawn()` repeatedly | Use `IsSpawned()` before calling `Spawn()` |
| Using transform without check | `CarryableSpawner.GetTransform()` | Use `if (CarryableSpawner.IsValid()):` before calling |
| Exploding without carryable | `CarryableSpawner.Explode()` | Check `IsSpawned()` first |
| Misusing events | `CarryableSpawner.OnPickUp()` | Use `.PickUpEvent.Subscribe()` correctly |

### üß† Best Practices
- Use `Enable()`/`Disable()` to manage spawner state.
- Use `ForcePlayerToCarry()` for quest-related logic.
- Combine explosion with gameplay mechanics.
- Track `CarryingAgent` to see who holds the item.
- Adjust explosion values for desired gameplay feel.
- Trigger `ThrowEvent` or `DropEvent` to detect mission completions.

### ‚úÖ Great For:
- Delivery/fetch missions
- Explosive payload objectives
- Puzzle mechanics using throw/drop
- Timed pickup events
- Team-based item games (capture-the-item)
