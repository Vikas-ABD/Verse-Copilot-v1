üß∞ Example Usage in Verse
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

player_spawner_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    PlayerSpawner : player_spawner_device = player_spawner_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        PlayerSpawner.SpawnedEvent.Subscribe(OnPlayerSpawned)
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

    OnPlayerSpawned(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Player spawned at spawner!")

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        PlayerSpawner.Enable()
        Print("Player spawner enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        PlayerSpawner.Disable()
        Print("Player spawner disabled!")
```

üß† Best Practices
* Name each player_spawner_device clearly in your level for easy assignment in Verse and logic clarity.
* Use Priority and Team/Class filters for advanced modes (e.g., team games, FFA, custom classes).
* Always test spawn eligibility and order when many spawners are used to avoid player stacking or misplacement.
* Subscribe to SpawnedEvent to trigger any gameplay adjustment needed right as players enter the space.

| Issue                             | ‚ùå Wrong                        | ‚úÖ Correct                               | Explanation                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Only one spawner for multiplayer | Only one placed for whole map  | Place one per spawn location/player     | Players need an available spot each          |
| Not enabling device              | Disabled in logic/event‚Äîno one spawns | Always call .Enable() or set enabled | Only enabled spawners function               |
| Expecting auto-team/class assignment | No filter set for team/class  | Configure desired restrictions in Details | Prevents spawn order confusion            |
| Not subscribing to SpawnedEvent  | No logic on spawn for effects/rewards | Always wire custom actions as needed | Unlocks full flexibility upon player spawn   |

üìå Note:
* The player_spawner_device only controls where an agent appears; use additional devices to set inventory, class, camera, or triggers for further setup.
* Optimally combine with player_checkpoint_device for progression/save systems.
