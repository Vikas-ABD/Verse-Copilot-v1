üìò lock_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

üîπ Description
The lock_device is used to control the locked, unlocked, open, and closed states of doors in your Fortnite island. This device only works when attached to assets that include a door (such as select galleries, props, and prefabs). You can control doors via Verse scripting, other device signals (such as from buttons, triggers, or events), or set their default state in UEFN. The device supports direct locking/unlocking, opening/closing, toggling state, and in-game access restrictions.
