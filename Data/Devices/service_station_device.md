## service_station_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

### üîπ Description
The `service_station_device` is an automated device in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) designed to refuel and repair vehicles automatically. When a vehicle enters the station, it is refueled or repaired depending on its needs. Ideal for racing or driving maps, this device can be used as a gas station, repair bay, or maintenance checkpoint. Events can be handled in Verse, such as when vehicles enter/exit or start/finish repairs or fueling.

### üß∞ Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }

station_manager := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    Station : service_station_device = service_station_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        Station.VehicleEnteredEvent.Subscribe(OnVehicleIn)
        Station.VehicleFuelingBeginEvent.Subscribe(OnFuelingStart)
        Station.VehicleRepairBeginEvent.Subscribe(OnRepairingStart)
        Station.VehicleFuelingEndEvent.Subscribe(OnFuelDone)
        Station.VehicleRepairEndEvent.Subscribe(OnRepairDone)
        Station.VehicleExitedEvent.Subscribe(OnVehicleOut)

    OnVehicleIn(Vehicle: fort_vehicle):void =
        Print("A vehicle entered the station!")

    OnFuelingStart(Vehicle: fort_vehicle):void =
        Print("Refueling started.")

    OnRepairingStart(Vehicle: fort_vehicle):void =
        Print("Repair started.")

    OnFuelDone(Vehicle: fort_vehicle):void =
        Print("Vehicle refueled!")

    OnRepairDone(Vehicle: fort_vehicle):void =
        Print("Vehicle fully repaired!")

    OnVehicleOut(Vehicle: fort_vehicle):void =
        Print("Vehicle exited the station.")
```

### üß† Best Practices
- Always mark your `service_station_device` as `@editable` and assign it in the UEFN Details panel.
- Use event subscriptions to implement gameplay responses (e.g., rewards, VFX, sounds).
- Control activation via `Enable()` and `Disable()` for dynamic gameplay logic.
- Use health and damage methods for destructible gameplay setups.
- Configure style and effects using the visual options in the Details panel.

### ‚ùå Incorrect Usage Examples and Fixes
| Issue                             | ‚ùå Wrong Example         | ‚úÖ Correct Example                  | Explanation                                          |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Unset editable reference         | Using station without init | Assign device in Details panel         | Prevents nil access and runtime errors               |
| Setting health directly to 0     | SetHealth(0.0)             | Use Damage() instead                   | Cannot set health < 1.0 directly                     |
| Events not triggered             | Subscribed without enable  | Use Enable() method                    | Device must be enabled to function                  |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Repairing/refueling only occurs if needed.
- Use `IsAnyVehicleInside()` for advanced scripts like blocking areas.
- Configure all bindings in UEFN Details for a smoother editor experience.
