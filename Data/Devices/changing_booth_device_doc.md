# changing\_booth\_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

## üîπ Description

The `changing_booth_device` allows players to change their outfit during gameplay. When a player interacts with the booth, it opens a UI that lets them choose from their locker cosmetics (within Creative rules). This enhances immersive scenarios such as:

- Roleplay games
- Team-based dress codes
- Mid-match disguise mechanics

Players interact with the booth like any other device, and it can be enabled or disabled dynamically through Verse or other devices.

## üö¶ Common Usage: Step-by-Step Example

```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }

booth_control := class(
    @editable OutfitBooth: changing_booth_device
):

    OnBegin<override>() :=
        OutfitBooth.Enable()  # Enable the booth when match starts

    DisableMidGame(): void =
        OutfitBooth.Disable()  # Optionally disable after a certain phase
```

## üß† Best Practices

- Use in roleplay, story-driven, or team-based islands to encourage identity shifts or uniform requirements.
- Combine with `trigger_device` to enable the booth only in safe zones or lobbies.
- Pair with class selectors to let players choose both class and outfit for immersive roles.
- Use team restriction settings to assign visual uniforms to specific groups.

## ‚ùå Incorrect Usage Examples and How to Fix

| Issue                     | ‚ùå Wrong                                 | ‚úÖ Fix                                                | Explanation                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Forgetting to enable      | Expecting booth to be active by default | Call `Enable()` in Verse or enable via Details panel | Must explicitly enable the device         |

| Conflicting classes/teams | All players can change freely           | Use class/team restrictions to control access        | Prevents undesired or unauthorized access |
