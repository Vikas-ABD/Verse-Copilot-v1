## vehicle_spawner_sports_car_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

### üîπ Description
The `vehicle_spawner_sports_car_device` is a specialized spawner that allows you to configure and spawn a Whiplash sports car in your Fortnite experience. It is based on `vehicle_spawner_device` and exposes all core vehicle spawner controls plus robust event handling for agents and vehicle lifecycle. This makes it straightforward to create races, rewards, or dynamic vehicle gameplay.

### üß∞ Verse Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Fortnite.com/Vehicles }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

sports_car_spawner_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    SportsCarSpawner : vehicle_spawner_sports_car_device = vehicle_spawner_sports_car_device{}

    @editable
    SpawnButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        SportsCarSpawner.SpawnedEvent.Subscribe(OnVehicleSpawned)
        SportsCarSpawner.DestroyedEvent.Subscribe(OnVehicleDestroyed)
        SportsCarSpawner.AgentEntersVehicleEvent.Subscribe(OnAgentEntersVehicle)
        SportsCarSpawner.AgentExitsVehicleEvent.Subscribe(OnAgentExitsVehicle)

        SpawnButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnSpawnPressed)
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

    OnVehicleSpawned(Vehicle : fort_vehicle) : void =
        Print("Sports car spawned!")

    OnVehicleDestroyed() : void =
        Print("Sports car destroyed!")

    OnAgentEntersVehicle(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Agent entered sports car!")

    OnAgentExitsVehicle(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Agent exited sports car!")

    OnSpawnPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        SportsCarSpawner.RespawnVehicle()
        Print("Sports car respawned!")

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        SportsCarSpawner.Enable()
        Print("Sports car spawner enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        SportsCarSpawner.Disable()
        Print("Sports car spawner disabled!")
```

### ‚ùå Common Issues & Fixes
| Issue | ‚ùå Problem | ‚úÖ Solution | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Car not spawning | Forgot to call `.RespawnVehicle()` | Use button or logic to spawn | No car unless spawned explicitly |
| Players can't enter car | Wrong team or allowed settings | Adjust in Details panel | Teams/limit configs block access |
| Verse event logic not firing | Forgot to subscribe to events | Subscribe in `OnBegin<override>()` | Needed for event-driven logic |
| Device hasn't got ref set | Did not set @editable fields | Set in Verse Details after placing | Required for Verse to work |

### üß† Best Practices
- Subscribe to vehicle events for advanced logic (scoring, race checkpoints, elimination on exit, etc.).
- Enable/disable the spawner with game phase to control when vehicles are available.
- Use `.AssignDriver(agent)` to script who controls the car at spawn/restart.
- Carefully configure respawn count and allowed teams for fairness and balance.
