### üìÜ UEFN Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Place Devices in Your Level
- Add a `vehicle_spawner_boat_device` where the boat should appear.
- Place `button_device`s for spawn, destroy, assign driver, enable, and disable functionality as desired.

#### 2. Create the Verse Script
- In Verse Explorer: Right-click folder ‚Üí **Create New Verse File** (e.g., `vehicle_spawner_boat_example.verse`)
- Choose **Create Empty** and paste the provided code example, then save.

#### 3. Build the Verse Code
- Click **Verse ‚Üí Build Verse Code** (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) until you see ‚ÄúBuild Succeeded‚Äù.

#### 4. Place and Reference the Verse Device
- Drag your Verse device from Content Browser into the world.
- In Details panel, assign:
  - `BoatSpawner` ‚Üí your placed boat spawner device
  - `SpawnButton`, `DestroyButton`, `AssignDriverButton`, `EnableButton`, `DisableButton` ‚Üí your placed buttons

#### 5. Configure the Boat Spawner
- Adjust respawn timer, access, appearance, and team/class settings in its Details panel.

#### 6. Test the Gameplay
- Press buttons in live mode to spawn, eliminate, assign driver, or enable/disable the boat.
- Watch log outputs to confirm event and control flow.

### üß† Tips
- Use multiple boat spawners for multi-boat setups.
- Control game logic or chain custom events via the provided event callbacks.
- `AssignDriver` requires a valid agent and a spawned boat.

### ‚ùå Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Boat does not spawn | Ensure the spawner device is enabled and set up |
| `AssignDriver` fails | Confirm agent and spawned state are valid |
| No output logs | Check event subscriptions and device references |

---

### ‚úÖ Note
Use the correct spawner for each Fortnite vehicle type. The device provides robust control both through settings and Verse APIs for dynamic, customizable gameplay experiences.
