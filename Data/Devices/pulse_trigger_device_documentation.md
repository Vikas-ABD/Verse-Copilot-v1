## pulse_trigger_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

### üîπ Description
The `pulse_trigger_device` is used to damage players who collide with its pulse and can also act as a trigger to activate other devices. It emits one or more pulses along a specified direction at a configurable speed and repeats for a set number of loops or indefinitely. Each pulse can deal damage, trigger linked devices, and be enabled/disabled or configured dynamically with Verse.

### üß± Verse Using Statement
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Functions & Methods
| Name               | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Enable()           | Activates the pulse trigger for use. |
| Disable()          | Disables the device (turns off pulses & activation). |
| Begin()            | Starts the pulse sequence (damage+triggers). |
| End()              | Ends the pulse sequence. |
| ResumePulse()      | Continues the pulse from where it stopped (use instead of deprecated Resume). |
| SetDamage(float)   | Sets how much damage players take per pulse (0-100,000). |
| GetDamage()        | Returns current damage value. |
| SetLoopCount(int)  | Sets how many pulses will fire (0 = infinite). |
| GetLoopCount()     | Get current pulse repetition setting. |
| SetWaveSpeed(float)| Sets speed the pulse travels (meters/second). |
| GetWaveSpeed()     | Gets the current configured speed. |
| GetTransform()     | Gets world location, rotation, and scale of the device. |
| MoveTo()/TeleportTo() | Animates or instantly moves the device in the world. |

### üéõ Configuration Options (Details Panel)
- **Loop Infinitely**: Repeat pulses forever.
- **Number of Loops**: How many times to pulse if not infinite.
- **Tempo (BPM)**: Pulse speed (can use BPM or meters/sec in Verse).
- **Length, Width, Height**: Zone size (how far/wide/tall the pulse travels).
- **Zone Direction**: Route/direction of the pulse (Forward/etc).
- **Activation Type**: What pulse trigger "does" on activation.
- **Zone Visible During Game**: Pulse visualization settings.
- **Damage**: How much damage is applied by the pulse.
- **Custom Pulse Style**: Enables alternate pulse visuals.
- **Transmit Received/Triggered**: Set which game phase, team, class, or event fires.
- *(Many more)*: Explore all options in UEFN Details panel.

### üß© Events
- This device does not expose explicit Verse events for on-pulse or on-damage, but can trigger other devices or be manipulated by Verse functions.

### üõ†Ô∏è Verse Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

pulse_trigger_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    PulseTrigger : pulse_trigger_device = pulse_trigger_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DamageVolume : damage_volume_device = damage_volume_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        # Subscribe to control buttons
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

        # Configure pulse trigger settings
        PulseTrigger.SetDamage(50.0) # Set damage to 50
        PulseTrigger.SetLoopCount(3) # Pulse will repeat 3 times
        PulseTrigger.SetWaveSpeed(2.0) # 2 seconds between pulses

    # Button control handlers
    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        PulseTrigger.Enable()
        Print("Pulse trigger enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        PulseTrigger.Disable()
        Print("Pulse trigger disabled!")
```

#### Explanation:
- The code references a `pulse_trigger_device` and two `button_device`s to allow enabling and disabling its effect.
- In `OnBegin`, you configure the pulse trigger's damage amount, loop count, and speed.
- When the enable/disable buttons are pressed, the pulse trigger is turned on or off accordingly.
- This device automatically damages any player who collides with the active pulse and can also be used to trigger other devices placed in its path.

### üìñ How to Use in UEFN
1. **Place the Pulse Trigger & Control Devices**
   - Add a `pulse_trigger_device` to your level.
   - (Optional) Add two `button_device`s to control enable/disable for demo or scripted logic.

2. **Configure Device Options (Details Panel)**
   - Set pulse direction, zone size, loop settings, damage, and all desired options.
   - Set any channel-based triggers for other devices as needed.

3. **Create a Verse Device**
   - In Verse Explorer, right-click a folder ‚Üí *Create New Verse File* (e.g., `pulse_trigger_example.verse`).
   - Click *Create Empty*, paste the supplied code, and save.
   - Click *Verse ‚Üí Build Verse Code* (Ctrl+Shift+B) until "Build Succeeded".

4. **Place Verse Device and Wire Up References**
   - Place your Verse device in the level.
   - In the Details panel, assign:
     - `PulseTrigger` ‚Üí your pulse_trigger_device
     - `EnableButton` / `DisableButton` ‚Üí your button devices

5. **Test in Play Session**
   - Run the experience, use the buttons to enable/disable, and verify the pulse triggers damage and can activate linked devices.

### üß† Best Practices
- Use Verse to dynamically enable/disable or reconfigure pulses for puzzles, boss attacks, or time-based hazards.
- To use as a trigger only (no damage), set damage to zero via Verse or Details.
- Combine with channel-triggered devices for full logic chains (doors, effects, etc).

### ‚ùå Common Issues & Solutions
| Issue | Mistake (‚ùå) | Fix (‚úÖ) |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| Damage not applied | Damage set to 0 or device not active | Set positive value and ensure enabled |
| Doesn't trigger other devices | No receiver set, bad channels | Configure receiver for target device |
| Can't control via Verse | @editable reference not set | Assign devices in Details panel |

> **Note:**
> - Pulse trigger delivers both damaging and logic-trigger signals, combining hazard and event trigger in one device.
> - Can be set up for timing, obstacle, or sequence-based play using all of the above methods.
