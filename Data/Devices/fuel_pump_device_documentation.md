## fuel_pump_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

### üîπ Description
The `fuel_pump_device` is used to provide fuel to vehicles in your Fortnite island. It supports infinite or limited fuel and can also act as a hazard by dealing damage to agents and the environment when destroyed or emptied. The device is configurable for team/class access, destructibility, scoring, and can be controlled dynamically using Verse scripting.

### üß∞ Verse Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

fuel_pump_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    FuelPump : fuel_pump_device = fuel_pump_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    ResetButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    EmptyButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        FuelPump.EmptyEvent.Subscribe(OnEmpty)
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)
        ResetButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnResetPressed)
        EmptyButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEmptyPressed)

    OnEmpty(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Fuel pump is empty!")

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        FuelPump.Enable()
        Print("Fuel pump enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        FuelPump.Disable()
        Print("Fuel pump disabled!")

    OnResetPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        FuelPump.Reset()
        Print("Fuel pump reset!")

    OnEmptyPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        FuelPump.Empty(Agent)
        Print("Fuel pump emptied by agent!")
```

#### Explanation
- This example wires a `fuel_pump_device` with four `button_device`s for enabling, disabling, resetting, and manually emptying it.
- Listens to `EmptyEvent` and prints log outputs for each action.

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Setup in UEFN
1. **Create the Verse Device**
   - Open Verse Explorer in UEFN.
   - Right-click a folder and select "Create New Verse File" (e.g., `fuel_pump_example.verse`).
   - Paste the code, save, and build (Ctrl+Shift+B) until "Build Succeeded".

2. **Add Devices to Your Level**
   - Place your `fuel_pump_example` Verse device into the level.
   - Place one `fuel_pump_device` and four `button_device`s for each control.

3. **Assign @editable References**
   - In the Details panel for the Verse device:
     - Assign `FuelPump` to your placed `fuel_pump_device`
     - Assign `EnableButton`, `DisableButton`, `ResetButton`, and `EmptyButton` accordingly

4. **Configure the Fuel Pump Device**
   - Set options like `Infinite Fuel`, `Health`, `Explosion Deals Damage`, etc., in the Details panel.

5. **Test Functionality**
   - Launch a play session.
   - Use the buttons to interact with the pump and observe printed logs.
   - If destructible and destroyed, verify that explosion and damage logic works.

### üß† Best Practices
- Enable "Indestructible: No" and "Explosion Deals Damage: Yes" to create hazards.
- Group multiple pumps for pit stops, checkpoints, or team play.
- Use `.Enable()`, `.Disable()`, `.Empty()` dynamically for events or win conditions.
- Leverage `EmptyEvent` for scoring, triggers, or chain reactions.

| Device not interactable| Left disabled or not reset                   | Use `.Enable()` or `.Reset()` in Verse or via buttons        | Must be enabled and stocked for use                  |
| No explosion/damage    | Explosion/Damage not enabled in Details      | Set "Explosion Deals Damage" and "Indestructible: No"        | Needed for hazard gameplay                           |
| No empty event logic   | Did not subscribe to `EmptyEvent`            | Use `EmptyEvent.Subscribe(...)` to handle event              | Needed for scoring/reward logic                      |

**Note:**
- All item/fuel logic is configured via the Details panel or Verse calls.
- Device supports team/class restrictions and visual customization.
- Use in various gameplay modes like races, sabotage, or checkpoints.
