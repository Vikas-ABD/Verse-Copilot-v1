üìò **hud_controller_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation**

üîπ **Description**
The `hud_controller_device` is used to show or hide parts of the player's HUD (heads-up display) for individual players, teams, or the entire game. This device lets you control HUD elements such as the minimap, elimination counter, health/shields, player count, round timer, team info, inventory, and more. You can use it to hide the entire HUD, disable only certain elements, or customize what information is visible during gameplay phases or events. Combine it with devices like `hud_message_device`, `map_indicator_device`, and `billboard_device` to optimize how and when information appears to players.

üß∞ **Usage Example**
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

# Example device showing how to use hud_controller_device
hud_controller_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    HUDController : hud_controller_device = hud_controller_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        HUDController.Enable()
        Print("HUD controller enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        HUDController.Disable()
        Print("HUD controller disabled!")
```

**How it works:**
- Place a `hud_controller_device` in your level and configure HUD elements in the Details panel.
- Use Verse or device connections to enable/disable settings during events like missions, eliminations, etc.
- Use `Enable()` and `Disable()` methods with button or trigger events.

üß† **Best Practices**
- Set elements to "Do Not Override" unless enforcing a change.
- Use `Priority` for tie-breaking between multiple devices.
- Combine with other UI-related devices for customized experience.
- Use Affected Team/Class for asymmetric game modes.
- Always playtest HUD setups in a live session.

üîó **HUD Priority & Override Hierarchy**
1. **User Settings** ‚Äì Players can always hide elements, cannot force-show hidden ones.
2. **Team Settings & Inventory Device**
3. **HUD Controller Device** *(this device)*
4. **Island Settings** ‚Äì Lowest priority.

| Only configuring, not enabling      | Device in level only           | Call `.Enable()` or enable via event   | Must be enabled to apply HUD settings                                      |
| Relying on lower priority           | Conflicting devices w/ low Prio| Set highest priority                   | Highest-priority device takes control                                       |
| Not resetting Affected Team/Class   | Lingering HUD changes          | Use `.ResetAffectedTeam()`/`.ResetAffectedClass()` | Clean up after gameplay changes                                              |
| Expecting player to restore hidden  | Depends on UI settings         | Use HUD device/island config to manage | Hidden elements can't be turned on by user UI if device overrides it       |

**Note:**
- Only the highest-priority HUD controller for a player/team applies at a time.
- Ideal for competitive, story-driven, or minimalist UI scenarios.
