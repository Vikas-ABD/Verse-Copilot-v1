üìò grind_powerup_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

üîπ Description
The grind_powerup_device is used to grant agents (players) a temporary ability that forces them to slide on any surface. While active, the player emits spark effects and ambient audio to indicate the duration of the powerup. This effect can enhance parkour courses, challenge arenas, or serve as a temporary speed/escape buff or debuff.

üõ†Ô∏è Verse Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

grind_powerup_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    GrindPowerup : grind_powerup_device = grind_powerup_device{}

    @editable
    SpawnButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        GrindPowerup.ItemPickedUpEvent.Subscribe(OnPowerupPickedUp)
        SpawnButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnSpawnPressed)

    OnPowerupPickedUp(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Grind powerup picked up by agent!")

    OnSpawnPressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        GrindPowerup.Spawn()
        Print("Grind powerup spawned!")
```

üìñ How to Use in UEFN
1. **Create the Verse Device**
   - Open *Verse Explorer*.
   - Right-click a folder, choose *Create New Verse File* (e.g., `grind_powerup_example.verse`).
   - Click *Create Empty*, paste the example code, and save.
   - Build with *Ctrl+Shift+B* until "Build Succeeded" appears.

2. **Add Devices to the Level**
   - Place your `grind_powerup_example` device into the level.
   - Add a `grind_powerup_device` and a `button_device` to your world.

3. **Assign @editable References**
   - Select the Verse device.
   - Assign:
     - `GrindPowerup` ‚Üí the placed `grind_powerup_device`
     - `SpawnButton` ‚Üí the placed `button_device`

4. **Configure Powerup in Details Panel**
   - Adjust properties like duration, team/class restrictions, pickup radius, audio, respawn settings.

5. **Test Your Setup**
   - Launch a session, press the spawn button.
   - Pick up the powerup to see the sliding effect and VFX/SFX.

üß† Best Practices
- Use as a buff, debuff, or movement event trigger.
- Combine `.HasEffect(agent)` and `.GetRemainingTime(agent)` for UI or HUD elements.
- Customize duration to match challenge difficulty.
- Place multiple powerups for varied pickup spots.

|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Not spawning on play      | Forgot `.Spawn()` or wrong spawn setting    | Call `.Spawn()` or set to spawn on game start            | Powerup must spawn to be collected        |
| Not subscribing to event  | Misses pickup detection                     | Use `.ItemPickedUpEvent.Subscribe(...)`                  | Needed to run logic when picked up       |
| Action applies forever    | No duration set                             | Use `.SetDuration(x)` and verify respawn time            | Controls effect duration                 |
| Leaving details default   | Unintended access or behaviors              | Configure class/team, pickup radius, and duration        | Avoid overly broad/default behaviors     |

üí≠ Note:
The grind effect overrides standard movement, forcing players into a sliding state, enhanced by spark VFX and ambient SFX. Perfect for challenge segments, event triggers, or adding a unique movement twist to your Fortnite island.
