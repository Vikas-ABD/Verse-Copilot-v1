# Gameplay Controls Device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

## üîπ Description
The `gameplay_controls_device` is a powerful and highly reusable device in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)** that dynamically manages **player input and movement control schemes**. This device enables developers to modify player control modes mid-game, supporting various perspectives and movement mechanics, such as **first person, third person, side scroller**, or **custom control restrictions**.

It can be toggled on/off, and its control schemes can be applied to specific players or globally. The device can also respond to gameplay phases or scripted Verse events.

## üßπ Typical Usage Patterns

### Dynamic Mode Switching
Use this device during **platformer sequences**, **boss battles**, or **scripted events** to dynamically switch control modes mid-game.

### Per-Player or Global Assignment
Utilize `AddTo` and `RemoveFrom` to target individual players, or `AddToAll` and `RemoveFromAll` for global changes.

### Advanced Stacking
Stack multiple `gameplay_controls_device` instances to orchestrate complex player control behavior.
