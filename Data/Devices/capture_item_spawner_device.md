# UEFN Verse Device Documentation: `capture_item_spawner_device`

## üìô Description
The `capture_item_spawner_device` is designed to spawn and manage a **single objective item** (e.g., a flag or diamond) in your Fortnite experience. It is ideal for **objective-based games** such as *Capture the Flag*, where only one instance of the item should be active at a time.

The device enables configuration of:
- Pickup/capture rules based on teams
- Drop and return behaviors
- Score awarding on capture
- Event-driven interactions via Verse

## ü™† Verse Usage Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

capture_item_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    CaptureItem : capture_item_spawner_device = capture_item_spawner_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        # Subscribe to capture item events
        CaptureItem.ItemPickedUpEvent.Subscribe(OnItemPickedUp)
        CaptureItem.ItemDroppedEvent.Subscribe(OnItemDropped)
        CaptureItem.ItemCapturedEvent.Subscribe(OnItemCaptured)

        # Subscribe to control buttons
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

    # Event handlers
    OnItemPickedUp(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Item picked up by agent!")

    OnItemDropped(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Item dropped by agent!")

    OnItemCaptured(Agent : agent) : void =
        Print("Item captured by agent!")

    # Button control handlers
    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        CaptureItem.Enable()
        Print("Capture item enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        CaptureItem.Disable()
        Print("Capture item disabled!")
```

## üí™ How It Works in UEFN
1. **Place Devices in Level**:
   - Add a `capture_item_spawner_device` in the desired location.
   - Optionally, add `button_device`s for manual control.

2. **Configure the Device (Details Panel)**:
   - Choose the item (e.g., Flag).
   - Set team pickup/capture logic.
   - Adjust return rules, score value, color, etc.

3. **Create & Build Verse Script**:
   - In Verse Explorer, create a new Verse file (e.g., `capture_item_example.verse`).
   - Paste the code and save.
   - Build the script via *Verse > Build Verse Code* or `CTRL+SHIFT+B`.

4. **Place & Reference the Verse Device**:
   - Drag the custom Verse device into the level.
   - Link editable fields in the Details panel:
     - `CaptureItem` ‚Üí your placed `capture_item_spawner_device`
     - `EnableButton` / `DisableButton` ‚Üí corresponding buttons

5. **Test Gameplay**:
   - Enter play mode and verify interactions.
   - Watch for event-driven logs and confirm behaviors.

## üß† Best Practices
- Pair with `capture_area_device` for full capture logic.
- Use events to reward players, transition rounds, or activate systems.
- Use `Return Dropped Items` settings to simulate classic or custom drop behaviors.
- Call `Disable()` to despawn items instantly via Verse or wiring.

## ‚ùå Common Issues & Fixes
| Issue | ‚ùå Wrong | ‚úÖ Correct | Explanation |
|-------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Events not working | Checked item visually | `.Subscribe()` to events | Required for Verse event logic |
| Incomplete config | Default/blank settings | Fully configure in Details panel | Ensures proper gameplay logic |
| Multiple item conflicts | Placed multiple spawners | One device per item | Only one active item per device |
| Item never appears | Forgot `Enable()` call | Enable via Verse or panel | Device must be active |
| Verse errors | Blank `@editable` fields | Assign references | Essential for Verse runtime |

---

## üìÖ Use Case
This device is ideal for:
- **Capture the Flag**
- **Heist Missions**
- **Single-Item Retrieval Modes**

Combined with other Verse logic and devices, it provides a powerful foundation for event-driven, objective-based gameplay in UEFN.
