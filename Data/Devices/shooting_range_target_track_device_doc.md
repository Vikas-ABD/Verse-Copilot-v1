## shooting\_range\_target\_track\_device ‚Äì UEFN Verse Device Documentation

### üîπ Description

The `shooting_range_target_track_device` provides a moving target that travels along a track and can be popped up or down to present shooting challenges for players. The track and its target are highly configurable: you can control position, speed, activation, reaction to being hit/eliminated, and how the device interacts with scoring, events, and gameplay logic. The device's events and actions can be fully managed in Verse or with in-editor settings.

### ‚ùå Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue               | Cause                      | Solution                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Target doesn‚Äôt move | Track movement not enabled | Call `.EnableTrackMovement()`    |
| No events triggered | Event not subscribed       | Use `.Subscribe()` in Verse code |
| Buttons do nothing  | References not set         | Assign all references in Details |

> **Note:**
>
> - For a stationary pop-up target, use `shooting_range_target_device` instead.
> - All device state changes (enable, move, pop) can be controlled in real-time with Verse.
