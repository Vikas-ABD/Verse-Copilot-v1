üéõ **Configuration Options (Details Panel)**
- Bounce Velocity: Set launch speed (meters/second); higher = higher/farther bounce.
- Is Indestructible: Prevents device from being damaged or destroyed.
- Device Health: Max health before device is eliminated.
- Visible During Game: Show/hide bouncer during play.
- Activating Team/Class: Restricts who can bounce.

üß∞ **Verse Usage Example**
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

# Example device showing how to use bouncer_device
bouncer_device_example := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    Bouncer : bouncer_device = bouncer_device{}

    @editable
    EnableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    @editable
    DisableButton : button_device = button_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends> : void =
        # Subscribe to control buttons
        EnableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnEnablePressed)
        DisableButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnDisablePressed)

    # Button handlers
    OnEnablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        Bouncer.Enable()
        Print("Bouncer enabled!")

    OnDisablePressed(Agent : agent) : void =
        Bouncer.Disable()
        Print("Bouncer disabled!")
```

üöÄ **How it works:**

1. **Place Devices in Level**:
   - Add one or more `bouncer_device` pads to your level.
   - Optionally place `button_device` objects to trigger enable/disable.

2. **Configure in Details Panel**:
   - Set Bounce Velocity, Healing, Air Control, Gravity, etc.
   - Choose Heal settings (Instant/Periodic/None).

3. **Create Verse Script**:
   - Add a new Verse file and use the example code above.
   - Build Verse code (Ctrl + Shift + B) until "Build Succeeded".

4. **Place Verse Device**:
   - Drag `bouncer_device_example` into the level.
   - Assign references in its Details panel:
     - Bouncer ‚Üí your `bouncer_device`
     - EnableButton ‚Üí a `button_device`
     - DisableButton ‚Üí another `button_device`

5. **Test**:
   - Click *Launch Session* or *Push Changes*.
   - Interact with control buttons and test the bounce functionality.

üß† **Best Practices**
- Use `.Enable()` and `.Disable()` for conditional gameplay control.
- Listen to `BouncedEvent` to trigger effects, award XP, or chain logic.
- Use team/class restrictions for advanced multiplayer logic.
- Tune Bounce Velocity and Forward Velocity for better player experience.
