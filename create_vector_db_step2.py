### üîπ Description
The player_spawn_device controls where and how players spawn or respawn in your island. You can dynamically enable/disable spawn points, teleport players to specific spawns, and respond to spawn events through Verse code.

This device is essential for creating custom respawn logic, team-based spawning, checkpoint systems, or event-triggered player positioning.

### üß± Imports Required
Include these at the top of your Verse file:

```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /Verse.org/Playspace }
```

### üîÅ Main Event
**PlayerSpawnedEvent**
Description: Fires when a player spawns at this spawn device.

Event Signal:
```verse
PlayerSpawnedEvent: listenable(agent)
```

Correct Handler Signature:
```verse
OnPlayerSpawned(Player: agent): void = ...
```

Subscription Example:
```verse
MySpawn.PlayerSpawnedEvent.Subscribe(OnPlayerSpawned)
```

### üß∞ Core Methods
| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| SpawnPlayer | SpawnPlayer(Player: agent): void | Forces a specific player to spawn at this device |
| Enable | Enable(): void | Enables the spawn point for use |
| Disable | Disable(): void | Disables the spawn point |
| IsEnabled | IsEnabled(): logic | Returns whether the spawn is currently enabled |

### üö¶ Common Usage: Step-by-Step Example
```verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
using { /Verse.org/Playspace }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }

player_spawn_example_device := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    TeamRedSpawn : player_spawn_device = player_spawn_device{}
    
    @editable
    TeamBlueSpawn : player_spawn_device = player_spawn_device{}

    OnBegin<override>()<suspends>: void =
        TeamRedSpawn.Enable()
        TeamBlueSpawn.Enable()
        
        TeamRedSpawn.PlayerSpawnedEvent.Subscribe(OnRedTeamSpawned)
        TeamBlueSpawn.PlayerSpawnedEvent.Subscribe(OnBlueTeamSpawned)

    OnRedTeamSpawned(Player: agent): void =
        Print("Red team player spawned: {Player}")
        
    OnBlueTeamSpawned(Player: agent): void =
        Print("Blue team player spawned: {Player}")
```)}

### ‚ùå Incorrect Usage Examples and How to Fix
| Issue | ‚ùå Wrong | ‚úÖ Fix |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Wrong handler signature | `OnPlayerSpawned(): void` | Must include agent parameter: `OnPlayerSpawned(Player: agent)` |
| Forgetting to enable | Just calling SpawnPlayer | Call `MySpawn.Enable()` first |
| Invalid player reference | `SpawnPlayer("PlayerName")` | Must pass agent: `SpawnPlayer(PlayerAgent)` |

### üß† Best Practices
- Use `@editable` to reference multiple spawn devices for different teams or areas
- Always call `Enable()` before using spawn functionality
- Combine with team assignment devices for proper team-based spawning
- Use `IsEnabled()` to check spawn availability before forcing spawns

Great for:
- Team-based game modes
- Checkpoint systems
- Custom respawn mechanics
- Event-triggered player positioning

Key Events and Subscriptions
Event Name	Handler Signature	Description	Example Subscription
EnemyEliminatedEvent	(Agent:agent):void	Fires when a member of this team eliminates an enemy. Sends the eliminator.	TeamDevice.EnemyEliminatedEvent.Subscribe(MyFunc)
TeamMemberEliminatedEvent	(Agent:agent):void	Fires when a team member is eliminated. Sends the eliminated agent.	TeamDevice.TeamMemberEliminatedEvent.Subscribe(MyFunc)
TeamMemberSpawnedEvent	(Agent:agent):void	Fires when a team member respawns or spawns. Sends the agent.	TeamDevice.TeamMemberSpawnedEvent.Subscribe(MyFunc)
TeamOutOfRespawnsEvent	():void	Fires when all members of this team run out of respawns.	TeamDevice.TeamOutOfRespawnsEvent.Subscribe(MyFunc)
Correct Handler Signatures (for Subscriptions):
EnemyEliminatedEvent.Subscribe(MyHandler)
MyHandler(Agent:agent):void = ...
TeamMemberEliminatedEvent.Subscribe(MyHandler)
MyHandler(Agent:agent):void = ...
TeamMemberSpawnedEvent.Subscribe(MyHandler)
MyHandler(Agent:agent):void = ...

MyHandler():void = ...
Incorrect Examples:
‚ùå Wrong parameter type: (Result: elimination_result):void
‚ùå Handler takes no parameters when event sends agent (except for TeamOutOfRespawnsEvent, which sends none)
Typical Verse Setup Example

        TeamDevice.TeamMemberSpawnedEvent.Subscribe(Handler.OnTeamMemberSpawned)
        TeamDevice.TeamOutOfRespawnsEvent.Subscribe(Handler.OnOutOfRespawns)

Typical Use Cases
Team Scoreboard: Track and display team-based eliminations or objectives by subscribing to elimination and spawn events.
Team Inventory: Use device‚Äôs advanced grant/clear item rules for respawn, defined in Details Panel (not Verse).
Round/Win Control: Use EndRound() method to declare team victory and end the round at any moment.
Custom Team Rules: Query IsOnTeam[Agent] or iterate with GetTeamMembers() for advanced team-based logic.
Device Options (UEFN Details Panel)
Option	Description
Team Name	Name/scoreboard label for HUD.
Team Color	Color for team visuals.
Team	Team index to control which players this config applies to.
Team Icon	HUD icon shown for team.
Default Class Identifier	Overrides for player class if using class system.
Grant Items on Respawn	Give team inventory when respawning.
Grant Condition	Always or Only when inventory is empty.
On-Grant Behavior	Clear all, clear items, or keep all on respawn.
Equip Granted Item	Which item(s) to forcibly equip on respawn.
Initial Weapon Ammo/Spare	Ammo to grant on spawn/respawn.
NOTE: Most config is set via the editor, not Verse!	
Best Practices and Common Mistakes
Aspect	Best Practice	Mistake Example
Subscribing to events	Always match handler signature to event	Passing wrong parameter type or wrong event name
IsOnTeam[Agent] usage	Use as a failable context (if (IsOnTeam[Agent]))	Using as regular function call (will not compile)
Get team members	Use .GetTeamMembers() returns []agent	Attempting to get classes/items via Verse fails
Ending round	Use .EndRound() for correct team win	Calling with agent input or on the wrong instance
Team win/loss logic	Always trigger win via method or event	Relying on score only‚Äîdoesn't auto end the round
Device-to-player	Get associations via UEFN team assignment/island	Expecting device to "find" team via agent input
Incorrect Usage Examples
‚ùå TeamDevice.EnemyEliminatedEvent.Subscribe(Foo(Result:elimination_result):void=...)
(Wrong event parameter type)
‚ùå TeamDevice.CompletedEvent.Subscribe(...)
(No such event)
‚ùå TeamDevice.IsOnTeam(Player) (Should be TeamDevice.IsOnTeam[Player] and in if or failure context)
‚ùå TeamDevice.EndRound(Player) (No parameters‚Äîmust be called with no arguments)
Advanced Example: Checking and Moving All Team Members
verse
for (Member:TeamDevice.GetTeamMembers()):
   if (TeamDevice.IsOnTeam[Member]):
      # Member is on this team, perform logic

Summary Table
What	Correct Example	Incorrect Example
Event Subscription	.EnemyEliminatedEvent.Subscribe(MyHandler)	Wrong event or wrong handler type

In Summary
Use this device for all per-team rule-sets in Verse.
Subscribe to team events and react in handlers.
Use .EndRound() for round control.
Use .IsOnTeam[] and .GetTeamMembers() for membership logic.

tracker_device ‚Äî Full Reference
Purpose
The tracker_device is used to count player, team, or channel-driven progress toward a goal (such as collecting items, performing actions, or receiving signals). When the tracked count meets the target, it triggers its completion logic, and can interact with other devices and Verse code.

Key Methods (Verse API)
Method	Description / Signature	Example Usage
SetTarget(Agent:agent, Value:int)	Sets a custom tracked value for a player. Must be called with a valid player agent.	MyTracker.SetTarget(Player, 5)
SetTitleText(Title:message)	Sets the visible label/title for the tracker to a localized message.	MyTracker.SetTitleText(MyMessage)
IncrementProgress(Agent:agent)	Increases the tracked count for a given agent (player).	MyTracker.IncrementProgress(Player)
ResetProgress(Agent:agent)	Resets progress for the given agent.	MyTracker.ResetProgress(Player)
Enable()	Enables the tracker device.	MyTracker.Enable()
Disable()	Disables the tracker.	MyTracker.Disable()

Key Event(s)
Event Name	Handler Signature	Description	Example Subscription
CompleteEvent	Handler(agent):void	Fires when a given agent completes the tracker objective (reaches goal).	MyTracker.CompleteEvent.Subscribe(OnCompleted)
Example subscription:

OnCompleted(Agent:agent):void = ... # Agent is the player who completed the tracker

Incorrect:
‚ùå MyTracker.CompletedEvent.Subscribe(...) ‚Äî *Incorrect event name*

Typical Setup Example
verse
@editable
MyTracker : tracker_device = tracker_device{}
 
OnBegin<override>()<suspends>:void=
    MyTracker.CompleteEvent.Subscribe(OnTrackerCompleted)
    MyTracker.SetTitleText(StringToMessage("Collect 5 Stars"))

        MyTracker.SetTarget(Player, 5)
 
OnTrackerCompleted(Agent:agent):void=
    # Do something when tracker completes for this agent

Common Configuration (Device Details Panel in UEFN)
Stat to Track:
Usually set to "Channel" for signal-based progress, or to in-game actions (eliminations, collections, etc).
Target Value:
The goal (how many events to track before completion).
Reset Between Rounds:
Whether progress resets each round.
Tracker Title:
The label visible to players.
You can also wire up channels for incrementing progress or handling tracker completion if not using Verse.
Correct Event & Subscription Rules
Always use .CompleteEvent (not .CompletedEvent).
Always subscribe with a function that takes a single agent parameter.
Incorrect Usage
Subscribing with the wrong event name (.CompletedEvent, .CompeteEvent, etc.).
Handler function with the wrong parameter type (elimination_result, ?agent, or no parameters).
Passing an array of agents or other types to methods/events.
Calling progress or completion methods outside of a failure context (if required).
Interaction with Other Devices
You can trigger other devices (such as trigger_device, end_game_device, item_granter_device, etc.) upon tracker completion via Verse in the event handler, or by wiring channels in the Details panel.
Verse lets you react programmatically to tracker progress and completion, enabling more dynamic gameplay control.
Quick Example: Awarding an Item When Complete
verse
@editable
MyTracker : tracker_device = tracker_device{}
@editable
RewardTrigger : trigger_device = trigger_device{}
 
OnBegin<override>()<suspends>:void=
    MyTracker.CompleteEvent.Subscribe(OnTrackerCompleted)
 
OnTrackerCompleted(Agent:agent):void=
    RewardTrigger.Trigger(Agent)

Summary Table
What	Correct	Incorrect
Event Name	.CompleteEvent	.CompletedEvent
Handler Sig	(Agent:agent):void	(Result: elimination_result):void or anything else
SetTarget	SetTarget(Agent, Target)	SetTarget(Players, Target) (no arrays)
Subscription	.Subscribe(MyFunc)	Wrong event name or handler type
Progress	Channel signal or method / UEFN	Calling with invalid agent
Tips
Always confirm the event and handler signature in Verse.
If you want tracker completion to be global (not agent-specific), you need to customize logic in Verse or through device settings.
Use SetTitleText for localization and better UI.
Prefer channel-based progression when integrating with other devices without Verse.

Correct Usage (Versus Mistakes)
Rule/Aspect	Correct Example	Incorrect Example
Set text	SetText(StringToMessage("msg"))	SetText("msg") (use message not string)
Text localization	Use <localizes> message for text	Direct string assignment
Text size limits	8 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 24	SetTextSize(100) fails, clamps to [8,24]
Color assignment	Use NamedColors.* or a color value	Using invalid type
Show/Hide text	ShowText() / HideText()	-
Border visibility	SetShowBorder(true/false)	-
Subscriptions	None (cannot subscribe to events)	-
Events/Triggers	Billboard does not emit events	-
Common Mistakes & Gotchas
Event subscription: billboard_device has no events to subscribe to.
Direct strings passed to SetText: must always convert via a localized message for best-practice and internationalization.
Text too long or size too large: only a portion may display, depending on billboard size and settings.
Advanced: Dynamically Updating Billboard (e.g., Scoreboard)
verse
var Score : int = 0
 
OnSomeGameEvent():void=
    set Score += 1
    Billboard.SetText(StringToMessage("Score: {Score}"))

Summary Table
Method/Event	Usage	Returns/Action
SetText(message)	Sets visible text	none
SetTextSize(int)	Sets text size [8,24]	none
SetTextColor(color)	Sets text color	none
SetShowBorder(logic)	Shows/hides border	none
GetShowBorder()	Checks border state	logic

tracker_device ‚Äî Full Reference
Purpose
The tracker_device is used to count player, team, or channel-driven progress toward a goal (such as collecting items, performing actions, or receiving signals). When the tracked count meets the target, it triggers its completion logic, and can interact with other devices and Verse code.

Key Methods (Verse API)
Method	Description / Signature	Example Usage
SetTarget(Agent:agent, Value:int)	Sets a custom tracked value for a player. Must be called with a valid player agent.	MyTracker.SetTarget(Player, 5)
SetTitleText(Title:message)	Sets the visible label/title for the tracker to a localized message.	MyTracker.SetTitleText(MyMessage)
IncrementProgress(Agent:agent)	Increases the tracked count for a given agent (player).	MyTracker.IncrementProgress(Player)
ResetProgress(Agent:agent)	Resets progress for the given agent.	MyTracker.ResetProgress(Player)
Enable()	Enables the tracker device.	MyTracker.Enable()
Disable()	Disables the tracker.	MyTracker.Disable()
> Note: Some tracker_device methods are for channel-based tracking set up in the UEFN Details Panel, and not directly callable in Verse.

Key Event(s)
Event Name	Handler Signature	Description	Example Subscription
CompleteEvent	Handler(agent):void	Fires when a given agent completes the tracker objective (reaches goal).	MyTracker.CompleteEvent.Subscribe(OnCompleted)
Example subscription:
verse
MyTracker.CompleteEvent.Subscribe(OnCompleted)
OnCompleted(Agent:agent):void = ... # Agent is the player who completed the tracker

Incorrect:
‚ùå MyTracker.CompletedEvent.Subscribe(...) ‚Äî *Incorrect event name*
‚ùå Handler(Result: elimination_result):void ‚Äî *Incorrect handler signature*
Typical Setup Example
verse
@editable
MyTracker : tracker_device = tracker_device{}
 
OnBegin<override>()<suspends>:void=
    MyTracker.CompleteEvent.Subscribe(OnTrackerCompleted)
    MyTracker.SetTitleText(StringToMessage("Collect 5 Stars"))
    if (Player := GetPlayspace().GetPlayers()[0]):
        MyTracker.SetTarget(Player, 5)
 
OnTrackerCompleted(Agent:agent):void=
    # Do something when tracker completes for this agent

Common Configuration (Device Details Panel in UEFN)
Stat to Track:
Usually set to "Channel" for signal-based progress, or to in-game actions (eliminations, collections, etc).
Target Value:
The goal (how many events to track before completion).
Reset Between Rounds:
Whether progress resets each round.
Tracker Title:
The label visible to players.
You can also wire up channels for incrementing progress or handling tracker completion if not using Verse.
Correct Event & Subscription Rules
Always use .CompleteEvent (not .CompletedEvent).
Always subscribe with a function that takes a single agent parameter.
Incorrect Usage
Subscribing with the wrong event name (.CompletedEvent, .CompeteEvent, etc.).
Handler function with the wrong parameter type (elimination_result, ?agent, or no parameters).
Passing an array of agents or other types to methods/events.
Calling progress or completion methods outside of a failure context (if required).
Interaction with Other Devices
You can trigger other devices (such as trigger_device, end_game_device, item_granter_device, etc.) upon tracker completion via Verse in the event handler, or by wiring channels in the Details panel.
Verse lets you react programmatically to tracker progress and completion, enabling more dynamic gameplay control.
Quick Example: Awarding an Item When Complete
verse
@editable
MyTracker : tracker_device = tracker_device{}
@editable
RewardTrigger : trigger_device = trigger_device{}
 
OnBegin<override>()<suspends>:void=
    MyTracker.CompleteEvent.Subscribe(OnTrackerCompleted)
 
OnTrackerCompleted(Agent:agent):void=
    RewardTrigger.Trigger(Agent)

Summary Table
What	Correct	Incorrect
Event Name	.CompleteEvent	.CompletedEvent
Handler Sig	(Agent:agent):void	(Result: elimination_result):void or anything else
SetTarget	SetTarget(Agent, Target)	SetTarget(Players, Target) (no arrays)
Subscription	.Subscribe(MyFunc)	Wrong event name or handler type
Progress	Channel signal or method / UEFN	Calling with invalid agent
Tips
Always confirm the event and handler signature in Verse.
If you want tracker completion to be global (not agent-specific), you need to customize logic in Verse or through device settings.
Use SetTitleText for localization and better UI.
Prefer channel-based progression when integrating with other devices without Verse.

item_remover_device ‚Äî Full Device Reference
Purpose
The item_remover_device is used to cause players to lose or drop items from their inventory under specific conditions‚Äîsuch as on elimination, on event triggers, or on action. Items can be removed, dropped, or dropped at a specific spot, with flexible options.

Device Methods (Verse API)
Method	Signature	Description	Example
Remove(Agent:agent)	Removes the configured set of items from the Agent‚Äôs inventory, following device configuration.	ItemRemover.Remove(Player)	
Enable()	Enables the item remover device.	ItemRemover.Enable()	
Disable()	Disables the device.	ItemRemover.Disable()	
Typically, only the Remove method is used in Verse scripting for actual item removal logic.
Direct Event Binding (Device Pin/Panel Connections)
Enable When Receiving From: Enable device when another device triggers an event.
Disable When Receiving From: Disable device when another device triggers an event.
Remove When Receiving From: Remove items when specific events occur on another device.
How to use:
In UEFN‚Äôs Details panel, set up direct binding so an event (such as a player elimination, trigger, button, etc.) causes one of these functions on the item remover to execute automatically.

Events
The item_remover_device does NOT emit events (not subscribable in Verse).
Instead, it responds to manual Verse calls with Remove() or to direct event binding or channel triggers.
Details Panel/Device Options Configuration
All functional options and how they affect gameplay:

Option	Values/Settings	Description
Enabled During Phase	None, All, Pre-Game Only, Gameplay Only	Controls when Remover is active.
Affected Objects	All Objects, Building Materials, World Resources, Objects in Device, Weapons and Items, Weapons, Items	Defines what can be removed.
Amount to Remove	Amount in Device, Percentage	How much to remove.
Percentage to Remove	100%, or custom percent	Shows if ‚ÄúPercentage‚Äù selected‚Äîthe percent of items taken.
Removal Method	Remove Items, Drop Items, Drop Items On Previous Ground Location	Remove from inventory or drop to the world.
Remove All Variations of Selected Item	On/Off	If on, removes all variants/rarities of the item chosen.
Allowed Team	Any, Pick a team	Restrict who can activate/removal is applied to.
Allowed Class	No Class, Any, Pick a class	Restrict to class/no class/anyone.
Apply To	Player, Players of Team, Players of Class, All Players	Who the removal affects.
Play Audio	On/Off	Plays sound on item removal.
Item List	Selected in panel	The list of items to target for removal/drop.
Note:
Many options interact (contextual filtering)‚Äîfor example, ‚ÄúPercentage to Remove‚Äù only shows if ‚ÄúAmount to Remove‚Äù is set to Percentage.
The core *which items* and *how* is set up in the Details panel, not via Verse.
Usage can be made team/class specific with these controls.
Typical Verse Usage Example
Common: Remove items from a player on event
verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
 
item_removal_example := class(creative_device):
    @editable
    ItemRemover : item_remover_device = item_remover_device{}
    @editable
    MyButton : button_device = button_device{}
 
    OnBegin<override>()<suspends>:void=
        MyButton.InteractedWithEvent.Subscribe(OnButtonPressed)
 
    OnButtonPressed(Agent:agent):void=
        ItemRemover.Remove(Agent)

Here, when a button is pressed, the specified items are removed/dropped from the player who interacted.
Design Example
Make a player instantly drop all their weapons on elimination:
1. Place an item_remover_device and configure:
Affected Items: Weapons and Items
Amount to Remove: Percentage (100%)
Removal Method: Drop Items
2. Set up an elimination trigger (e.g., use Down But Not Out device or subscribe to character elimination in Verse). 3. On elimination event, call ItemRemover.Remove(Agent).
Correct Usage Rules
Only call Remove(Agent) on a valid agent (player reference).
Configure all target items/settings in the UEFN Details panel.
Use direct event binding for no-code workflows, or Verse for custom scripting.
No events can be subscribed to‚Äîthe device is action-only.
Incorrect Usage / Common Mistakes
Mistake	Why it Fails/Odds Result
Calling ItemRemover.Remove() with no agent	Fails‚Äîmust provide a valid agent
Trying to subscribe to events (none exist)	No events to subscribe to
Expecting to remove items not listed in options	Only items as per config will be removed
Setting conflicting teams/classes/config	Device may not apply if rules conflict
Passing arrays to Remove()	Only single agent accepted per call
Best Practices
Always test your ‚ÄúAffected Objects‚Äù and ‚ÄúApply To‚Äù settings for expected gameplay.
When scripting with Verse, combine with triggers, buttons, or elimination events for best effect.
Use direct event binding for simple cause/effect setup in the Details panel.
Summary Table
What	Example Code / Setting	Note
Remove method	ItemRemover.Remove(Agent)	Verse call; agent required
Enable/disable	ItemRemover.Enable(), ItemRemover.Disable()	Optional via Verse
No events	‚Äî	Cannot subscribe
Setup affected items	UEFN Details Panel ‚ÄúItem List‚Äù option	Not Verse
Amount/Method/Rule config	All set in Details panel	Not in Verse
Direct event binding	‚ÄúRemove When Receiving From‚Äù in Details	No code needed
Practical Advanced Pattern
Combining item removal and item granting in a workflow:
verse
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }
 
@editable
ItemRemover : item_remover_device = item_remover_device{}
@editable
ItemGranter : item_granter_device = item_granter_device{}

Restore Player Shield on Elimination	On/Off	Restore player's shield when they eliminate a spawned creature.
> Note: Many advanced settings (e.g. event-based enabling/disabling, direct event binding to buttons/timers, etc.) are controlled by connecting devices in UEFN or via Verse.

Direct Event Binding / Channel Triggers
Enable When Receiving From: Channel/event can trigger spawner to begin operation.
Disable When Receiving From: Channel/event can stop spawner and despawn creatures.
Other devices (triggers, buttons, timers, etc.) can be linked in the Details panel for non-scripting control.
Example Use Cases
Waves of Enemies: Turn spawner on/off via Verse, triggers, or game phase. Configure for escalating waves by changing device options.
Interactive Encounters: Enable spawners when a button or player reaches a zone.
Reward Logic: Upon spawner‚Äôs EliminatedEvent, grant items or open areas to players.
Correct Subscription & Usage Rules
Subscribe to SpawnedEvent with (Agent:agent):void
Subscribe to EliminatedEvent with (Result:device_ai_interaction_result):void
Call Enable()/Disable() to control spawn activation from Verse
Configure spawn limits and behavior in UEFN Details panel
Incorrect Usage Examples
Incorrect Example	Why it‚Äôs Wrong
Spawner.CompletedEvent.Subscribe(...)	No such event; correct is SpawnedEvent or EliminatedEvent
Handler with wrong type: (Result: elimination_result)	EliminatedEvent sends device_ai_interaction_result
Calling methods on null/unset device reference	Device must be set via @editable and assigned in editor
Expecting direct player control of enemies	Only Verse, device, or sequence events can control them
Best Practices
Always set correct handler signatures.
Test device settings (count/limit/range) for your gameplay design.
Use Details panel for visual and functional configuration (creature type, appearance, limits).
Use Verse methods for dynamic, script-based control.
Summary Table
What/Feature	Correct Example	Note
Enable/Disable	Spawner.Enable(), Spawner.Disable()	Verse/control device
